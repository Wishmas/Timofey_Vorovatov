Riding on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sitting in leather, riding on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again
No, he won't
You were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
My social workers got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name
Yes, it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks run out next week
It won't be very long till  I'm back
On the streets again
Now, now you were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes,  I am
I'm gonna ride on you, baby
I hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Baby,  I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute  I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby,  I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Currie says we're on the edge
He says, man you're really graphic
This band's a social wedge
We all got hearts made of metal
And our blood's hot molten rock
And if  I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
So mister  D. J., play just one for me
You know the one with the crushing
And the screams
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Mama's having problems, always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you  I'm a loser cause  I like being free
The truth is in the mirror, it's what they never see
I said, yeah, a long time ago
They tried to tell me, son, keep our daughter home
I said no, no, no, no
Now,  I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying for me
A fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
Only sixteen, a woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world
Pick you up on  Friday when your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on  Sunday
When he's watching  Billy  Graham on  T V
He won't see me
Now, do it right with music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
Now,  I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying for me
A fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
I don't know
Well, 
there's no charge for the haircut And the bullets come free
My uncle  Sam send a letter, said
Got a mission for me
Now,  I'm a ranger not a stranger
And  I live in  Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that  I've lost my mind
Baby, it's not gone just a little hard to find
About the time this letter gets home
I'll be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that  I'm 
M. I. A
Think a little less about me each day
Cause if  I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a 
B. A. R
I know  I'm home
But  I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world  I'm brave
The businessmen sat home
Well,  I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa, alright
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
We met on  English ground In a backstage room we heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew soon the time
Would come for us to fight
Destination now in sight
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands and take a stand
Look sharp when duty calls
Where we march, cities fall
And the strong survive and take our side
Now the time has come for us to fight
Target waiting in our sights
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar, born to live forevermore
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eyes
Took his land and fortune
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline
Left for the tide
Sees his lifeblood leaving
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the  Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
And in the world above
The elders sing
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring
He was met at the gate of  Hades
By the  Guardian of the  Lost  Souls, the  Keeper of the  Unavenged
And  He did say to him
" Let you not pass, abandon
Return to the world from whence you came
And seek payment, not only for thine own anguish
But vindicate the souls of the  Unavenged"
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him
Called  Vengeance, forged in brimstone
And tempered by the woeful tears of the  Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
They brought forth their  Demon horse called  Black  Death
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire
And on that night they rose up from  Hell
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood  I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On  Black  Death  I ride
When kissed by the sword of  Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that  I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get their lives
But when  I'm through they know they must pay
With their lives, with their lives
By moonlight, we ride
Ten thousand side by side
With swords drawn, held high
Our whips and armor shine
Hail to thee, our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gone are the days, when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's wake
The sense of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the battle, we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men die
We crossed a starlit sky
And still, no space and time
We'll catch the wind
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wait, listen Hey, what, what's this supposed to be? She's only sixteen Come here you Hey, she wanted it, man
When you see me coming
Flying down the road
You know  I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yeah, got me some leather
Leather is my skin
Black and chrome flashing
Through the town
Some call me the warlord
Cause  I'm a goddamn fast machine
Young and hungry
Not too proud and mean
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Take what  I want and  I go where  I please
Got the world right by the balls
This world ain't big enough
To keep me down
Yeah, we're living in a sick world
The man on the  T V said we got
Lots of trouble overseas
Well, what the  Hell do  I care?
You think they care about me?
Stop sending money
Send them all a bomb
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Born to live in a fast lane
On a chopped up  Harley  D
Smell that oil and high test gasoline
Never got a shortage of girls
To share my seat
Well, they all want to know
What people say is true
You know, get a biker started
And he'll drive all damn night
Well, hold on, honey
Cause this ride's for a ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Atop the mountain
Where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest
White was the snow
There as children
How could children know?
One without name or number
Soon would show
There stood he
On his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old
A scepter of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold, the creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear wisdom's voice
Rise, know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart, but never reveal
You were called by the  Gods
Their powers to wield
Guard well the secret of steel
A scepter of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold, the creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear wisdom's voice
Rise, know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart, but never reveal
You were called by the  Gods
Their powers to wield
Guard well the secret of steel
And the great sword of steel
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes
We rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads
Awaken to their dreams
The sound of metal
So loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors
Called the metal kings
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together, we are all
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together, we are all
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
Leather, metal, spikes and chains
Gloves of metal, raised to show the brave
Into the darkness
March the armies of the night
Bound by metal, we live the fight
We wear leather, we wear spikes
We rule the night
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
Valhalla, the  Gods await me
Open wide thy gates
Embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last farewell
To the  Viking land
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal,  I am there
I take my place by  Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing as  I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of  Odin onward ride
Valhalla, the  Gods await me
Open wide thy gates
Embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry
I taste your blood
As it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
I take your powers
To the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth, ye wicked
Know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside
My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
I crush your bones,  I kill your face
I rip your flesh,  I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world, the rats that race
My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
Hatred
Above the wreckage of your mortal world  I stand
Judgement passed, delivered by his hand
Now, clear the smoke
There the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man
What was written, foretold in dreams
In visions apocalypse now seen
And all self-righteous fools
Who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Dine with the  Beast
Vindication, he's coming on the clouds
See his  Angels Hear their trumpets sound
The day of anger
When the stars fall from the sky The moon turns red The sun turns black as night
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star
The four  Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
His hair as white as wool His eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last
He brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death For the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star
The four  Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, 
the first trumpet blows Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail and fire on  Satan's throne
Revelation
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Ride, ride, ride
Ride up from  Hell
Armed with magic
Sons of  Demons and men
This song of greeting
Written for your tragic end
So long our stride
The world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Hot pitch and chain
Take to the air
Our ramming blades
Lay their ships hold bare
Steel meets steel
Axes, broadsword and shield
Their heads ride our spears
And bodies cover the fields
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Fallen brother, as  I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last
Mighty earth, now doth drink your blood
And  I remember days long past
Your sacrifice so great
Rest now, take thy sleep
For you shall not awake
Let revenge be sweet
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
You who killed my brother
And all who take your side
This be your last hour
Let your steel be tried
Now turn to face me
Upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can
Death is life
By the full moon they rise from their graves
Through seas of blood
Fighting with  Hell bent rage
Swear the creed of unity
By the circle of blood, we are one
We know not fear, born to fight, not run
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Three sons have  I and they ride by my side
The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names
We ride down my enemies on their half-hearted flight
No voice of mercy, no evangels of light
Mighty messengers, heathens rage
Witness our coming,  Gods of the death
I ride through the air,  I laugh as  I die
With powers of evil, dark knowledge is mine
The ride of the wicked, the first sin was trust
Kill without warning, for blood now  I lust
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Three sons have  I and they ride by my side
The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names
We ride down my enemies on their half-hearted flight
No voice of mercy, no evangels of light
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Passing through the storm led by  Demons
Walk between the world of men and  Gods
Cast no shadows, draw no light
I rape the priestess on pagan night
I taste the serpent's poison
On the lips of the one  I love
She brings this gift of witchcraft
I wear the cat skin gloves
Apples of youth when  I wrought mischief
Hung on a tree to rot in the sun
Reborn in the middle of the final orgy
A gift of slavery to the chosen one
Suicide, suicide, don't you know me?
Call to the master, he will come
He will bring our resurrection
Cloaked in darkness, he has won
Smoke from my sacrifice
Journey to the isle of the blessed
Grant my soul your glory, at nighttime,  I'm your guest
Only  I know why each dawn  I die
I die
Smoke from my sacrifice
Journey to the isle of the blessed
Grant my soul your glory, at nighttime,  I'm your guest
Only  I know why each dawn  I die
Hear what's written on the wind
We come to kill and kill again
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead
Ride through the gate of clouds
Stand on the open step
Run berserk, spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chains
None can harm us, not their fire, iron or steel
For we have the 
will to power
With power we will kill
Kill with power
Die, die
Kill with power
Die, die
Die
Kill with power
Die, die
Die, die
Die
To the war  God  Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shall remain
Yes, it will
On the blood of all our fathers
On their weapons we now swear
To avenge, not lament
Give 
the false ones
 death
Raise sails, head for the open sea with sails full of wind
Our hearts overflown with belief, the quest for the grail
To  England we sail with our steel, we bring what was lost
If lives are the cost, let it be
Strong she stands
Reaching her hand
Brave and grand
On  English ground we were born
Proudly we return to  English shores
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
We march from the hills down to  London  Town
Join, raise your hand or hide when we ride for the crown
The sign of the hammer and the black winds blow through the night
Long was our wait, our meeting with fate is tonight
Strong she stands
Reaching her hand
Brave and grand
On  English ground we were born
Proudly we return to  English shores
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Standing tall, one and all, light the hall
Years have passed
I've dreamed of this day
As we raise our hands
We proudly say
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Battle hymns did sound the call
You came to our side
You heard true metal Into glory ride
Come on
You stood beside us
The false ones cried
Your love is judgement
You gave us life
You wait in the rain
You walk through the snow
We give you our blood
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more
We have read your letters
We have heard your call
We were brought together
Cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal
So hard and wild and mean
You'll live forever
We were born from your belief
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more
Metal makes us strong
It makes us
Metal makes us strong
It makes us stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger
Metal makes us strong
Let each note  I know play
Be a black arrow of death
Sent straight to the hearts
Of all those who play false metal
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show
And this last time looking back,  I'll see my home
For he awaits me, reaching for my soul
He calls my name and waves me on
The fallen one, he stands in flame
Well, the life that he has given
Full of riches and success has a price
That  I made good in blood to pay
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance
If  I falter on my way
And what  God has now forsaken
And man has never seen
Are the riches of the underworld below
All my years of earthly pleasures
Gave support unto the bridge
I now cross it giving him my soul
Dark lord,  I summon thee
Demanding the sacred right to burn in  Hell
Ride up on  Hell's hot wind
Face one more evil than thou
Take my lustful soul
Drink my blood as  I drink yours
Impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head, release all my evil
Lucifer is king, praise  Satan
I know the one who waits
Satan is his name
Across the bridge of death
There he stands in flame
I know the one who waits
Satan is his name
Across the bridge of death
There he stands in flame
He is my provider as  I walk into the void
For eternity  I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding
Obey him without question
Even walk among the living if  I'm told
Satan, don't forsake me
I wait for you to take me
Grant me wings and as your messenger
I'll fly
I made a rock'n'roll sin
When  I tried givin' in to
Make money had to turn down low
They said, " Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute
Get a haircut and buy small gear"
That's when  I turned to them and said
" Hold it, right there!"
Well it's more to me than just a job
And while  I'm playin' you won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey
Can you hear me say...
All men play on ten Never gonna turn down again All men play on ten Never gonna turn down
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220
Step back and let my fingers fly
While  I'm burning up my gear
There's a fire in your ear
That won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when  I hear the crowd roar
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream
Then  I run back to the power rack
And deck all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job
And while  I'm playin' you won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey
Can you hear me say...
Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot,  I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
And leave you in the morning feeling right
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I've been looking, you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide
Oh, your getting wet, your working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night you won't forget
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
Black clouds on the horizon Great thunder and burning rain His chariot pounding I heard the  Heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to  Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder,  God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never-ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to  Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to  Odin and  Gods on high
And leave the mortal world
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds
Where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down
On one so strong
They cut but never change
What stood so long
Tall as a mountain
I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground,  I'm in the air,  I am all
I live in the hearts of men
I'm the call to greatness, not all can hear
I awaken the creator in those who dare
And the day will come when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain
I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
The spell has been broken
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind
On the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the  Gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Pounding, pounding
We're back from the dead
Those who denied us, are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph
And live by the sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
The spell has been broken
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind
On the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the  Gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Old men and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites
False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
They'll find no sanctuary
Hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and the flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism
Linger after death
So hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain
Feel the dragon's breath
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath,  I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites
False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath,  I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Thank you for the  Kool- Aid, reverend  Jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh, a sacrificial lamb
Were you our  God or a man in a play Who took our applause and forced us to stay?
Now all together, we lived as we died
On your command, by your side
Die by your side
Guyana, in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana, in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
In the cult of the damned, we all worked the land
Too afraid to look up, we all feared his hand
Hurry, my children, there isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side
Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink, they're dying of thirst
Guyana, in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Bigfoot, bigfoot, thrown in a well
Pulled under water, screaming like  Hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang the bell

Guyana, in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

I made a rock n' roll sin, when  I tried giving in
To make money had to turn down low
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud, be like us
And get  A sound that's real thin
Wear  A polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get  A haircut
And buy small gear"
That's when  I turned to them and said, hold it, right there
Well it's more to me than just  A job, and while  I'm playin'
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells  A man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While  I'm burning up my gear, there's  A fire in your ear
That won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when  I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then  I run back the power rack and deck, all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just  A job, and while  I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells  A man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
Well it's more to me than just  A job, and while  I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells  A man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I wrote a letter to the  M. T. V
What's going on now?
Don't you care about me?
Sent the same letter to the radio
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it- Rock and  Roll
We all want it- On your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playing
It just ain't worth my saying
People want music to get them moving
We don't want labels
We want music on the table
We all like it- Rock and  Roll
We all want it-on your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll

Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll
Blow your speaker... Rock and  Roll (repeated)
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And  I wait for the sun when all are one
I shall not betray
Calling at me,  I'm waiting
When all are led astray
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on for when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No-one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Coming at us, no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Yeah, be my brother
Fight to stay alive

We won't run and hide
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walking the streets
Scums have their day
'til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin' to me
I'am armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in nam shot up my friends
I'm back in the streets the fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But  I'll die like a man
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Now we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch and  I'm paying all
All my life  I been waitin'to see
Who's gonna win crumbs or me
Are you ready
My brother's still in da-nang
Puttin'an ad in the back of kerrang
I'm looking for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back the nam cause no one else will
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed

I have seen the fire Of a thousand suns pass by While blasphemers spread their  Gospel Bearing false witness Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions, all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, holy war Holy, we are fighting Fighting a holy war Holy war, see us fly on winds of doom Holy war, baptised in fire and steel Holy war, for the end we bring is soon Holy war, now face the storm A holy war
Brothers of metal, know no masters
Metal's our religion, take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth, our dawn of glory
All reborn, we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep these dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black dogs howl in the night
The lion, the lion is dead
A solitary messenger
The master of revenge
Full moon light's calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat  I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
And steel is on my side
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn

Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline
Every light  I see is green
Open pipes
My machine's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now, you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, fast, fast, fast
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood's nitroglycerin,  I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me
To scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke, tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Manowar,  Manowar, living on the road When we're in town, speakers explode We don't attract wimps Cause we're too loud Just true metal people That's  Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills Other bands play,  Manowar kills
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps Man, they blast
True metal people wanna rock, not pose
Wearing jeans and leather
Not  Cracker  Jack clothes
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills Other bands play,  Manowar kills
Now listen to me
We are the kings of metal
Coming to town
When we light up
Have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
Cause there ain't no way
That we'll ever turn down
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills We're the kings of metal Kick your ass Kick your ass Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass We're the kings of metal Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass We're the kings of metal Manowar kills Kick your ass Manowar kills We're the kings of metal Kick your ass Coming to town Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass Kings of metal Manowar kills Kick your ass
Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world
And take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where  I stand  I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
From a battle  I've come
To a battle  I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when  I die
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes, await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as  I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin,  I await thee
Your true son am  I
I hail you, now as  I die
I pledge you my sword
And to no man  I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
See the white light, the light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Now, rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice
That speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Now, feel the white light, the light within
Yeah, it burns a fire
Drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Words of power calling to us all Holding us together While other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting Our kingdom has come Kingdom come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come
She is waiting to kiss my hand
But she will wait for my command
My chains and collar brought her to her knees
She now is free to please
Woman be my slave
That's your reason to live
Woman be my slave
The greatest gift  I can give
Woman be my slave
Before her surrender, she had no life
Now she's a slave, not a wife
Her only sorrow is for women who live with lies
She's taken off her disguise
Woman be my slave
Chained unto my bed
Woman be my slave
Begging to be fed
Your body belongs to me
Woman come here
Remove your garments
Kneel before me
Please me
Woman be my slave
Chained unto my bed
Woman be my slave
Begging to be fed
I want you now
Woman be my slave
Brothers,  I am calling From the valley of the kings With nothing to atone A dark march lies ahead Together we will ride like thunder from the sky May your sword stay wet Like a young girl in her prime Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting
Like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while  I live
Now as  I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Now, power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
My father was a wolf
I'm the kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
Now  I will bring salvation
Punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Rip their flesh, burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants, burn their homes
Kill till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Grandfather, tell me a story!
All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story!
A real story?
Yes, tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then,  I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As  I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sound of horses, and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on
And find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill
Before me the armies of the worlds standing, waiting
I thought to myself
For whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up
From the north there appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle ax
From the east came a third holding a spiked club
And finally from the west, a rider who wielded a great hammer of war
With them came their soldiers of death
Followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound
Storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and the four winds blew with such anger
That  I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air
Without warning, screaming their war cry
They led the attack, down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash!
I could feel the ground shake
The earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was unto himself
A whirlwind of doom!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield
Like brown leaves blown by the wind
And  I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words
Of the warrior's prayer
Gods of war  I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if  I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail, hail
And as  I stood and looked on
I heard the armies of the world hail them without end
And their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land!
Well, that's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh good,  I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they?
They were the metal kings!
Brothers, the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the battle hymns Into glory ride Hail to  England The sign of the hammer's our guide Forever we're fighting the world Side by side
On a crusade, the world we bring Four kings of metal Four metal kings Death to the false ones
, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king

The blood of a king
Our armies in  England,  Ireland,  Scotland and  Wales Our brothers in  Belgium,  Holland and  France will not fail Denmark,  Sweden,  Norway,  Finland,  Italy Switzerland,  Austria Back to the glory of  Germany
On a crusade, the world we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Sound the death tone
On our march for revenge
Spill the blood of my enemies
The oath of a friend
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring
Six magic circles made
By the blood of the kings
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Sound the death tone
On our march for revenge
Spill the blood of my enemies
The oath of a friend
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring
Six magic circles were made
By the blood of the kings
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king

The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Blood of a king, blood of a king
Blood of a king
( Prelude)
See my chariot, run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold, the wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The  Gods are my shield, my fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall, we are storming the wall
Stones fall like snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory in the fire of battle
Zeus, today is mine
Killing all in my way like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer,  I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me, let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye? This was your time, but the armor you wore was mine I will not rest until  Hector's blood is spilled His bones will all be broken, dragged across the field This, dear friend, is how we'll say goodbye Until we meet in the sky

Here inside the walls of  Troy, the  Gods weigh my fate
From this day do  I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
Many thousands  I did kill
No walls can contain the  Gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices,  I cannot hide The  Gods leave no choices, so we all must die Oh  Achilles, let thy arrows fly, into the wind Where eagles cross the sky Today my mortal blood will mix with sand It was foretold  I will die by thy hand Into  Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the  Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge and bringeth fury
Hector, feel my hate
A bloodbath  I was born to bring, by birth  I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and death
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire, death and hate Your body  I will desecrate Dogs and vultures eat your flesh The  Hall of  Hades waits Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
The  Gods who once protected him are now his  Gods of doom
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the  Gods give no protection
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the  Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate Your body  I will desecrate Dogs and vultures eat your flesh The  Hall of  Hades waits Die...

The oath of the  Gods, this day was fulfilled In the heat of the battle,  Hector was killed See him  Patroclus, down in the dust Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths have been killed
Cutting their throats, their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground Hector's body dragged three times around I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
Until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken, a promise fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed
Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of true metal
Proud and standing tall
We know the power within us
Has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal
There's magic in us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers,  I said leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend
There's metal in the air tonight
Can you hear it call?
If you ain't got the balls to take it
You can leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Demon's blood and dragon's fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient  Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible,  I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that  I'm not there
With a spell  I send them
Crashing to the ground
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman
I make a secret sign
Now, welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman
A dragon  I must ride
The gates of  Hell are open, let me in
Rule in  Hell or serve in  Heaven
Choose an altar or a throne
All commandments and
Laws of man disown
Now, eat the fruit of knowledge
Unto no-one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient  Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible,  I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that  I'm not there
With a spell  I send them
Crashing to the ground
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be re, die to be re
Die to be reborn
The trail of tears began for the  Cherokee
The white man came to trade and borrow
But then, they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers
Knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters, not the hunted
As the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals
We live among them free
Our trail of tears would end
One day at  Wounded  Knee
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
When we do the ghost dance
The 
buffalo
 will return
Paint ourselves for war
Now blood and fire burn
Great  Spirit, make us strong
Take us to the sky
The  Cherokee are brave
We are not afraid to die
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Red  Cloud,  Black  Hawk,  Sitting  Bull
Crazy  Horse,  Geronimo
Strong and brave, warriors to the grave
There has been much killing
There will be much more
The medicine man is dancing
He's calling us to war
Hatches sing with pride
Let the white man die
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
We have come from the ashes
Of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire
On the altar of pain
Led into temptation
Now, the black  Gods align
Here, there is no salvation
And your blood is my wine
Here's a world that is waiting
Between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure
Are eternally wet
All is all for the taking, for a life or a lie
At the end of the breaking
I'll be watching you die
Crawl to the silence, renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers
Foretold of this time
To the words and the wisdom
To the promise of lies
By their anger and fury
The strong will survive
Lord of battle,  I pray on bended knees
Conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command
With flame and blood at hand
Glory and a broken sword
I'm the master of the world
I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone
With steel and stone
Eternal might,  I was born to wield
Let us drink to the battles
We've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc
We have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
Drink to the battles
We've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc
We have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
The clash of honour calls
The clash of honour calls
I will stand when others fall
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
Open magic doors
They will know the power of my sword
There is blood on my hands
There is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice
I scream as you die
Thirsting of vengeance
And mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
Black candles slowly burning
White fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations
Summon living fire
Darkest forces and your  Demons
Black order, black king
The cult that serves the living
Accept this offering
Black candles slowly burning
White fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations
Summon living fire
As the seven steps await
Hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure
The enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness
Of the molten seas of  Hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols
In evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your  Demons
Black order, black king
The cult that serves the living
Accept this offering
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts
Now, sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction
Behold the evil eye
And the  Demon's whip
Armies of the  Gods of  Hell
Ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction
Sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness
All born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil
Grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells
Death can live, when all life dies
Wage eternal war on  Heaven
Immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons
Are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant
One needs a greater sin
Night winds, oblivion
See my dark desire
Come forth and appear, he is living fire
Feel the  Demon's whip
Armies of the  Gods of  Hell
Ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction
Sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness
All born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil
Grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells
Death lives, when all life dies
Wage eternal war on  Heaven
Immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons
Are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant
One needs a greater sin
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
In the silence of the darkness
When all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream
Calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind
Hear the  Angels sing
Far beyond the sun
Across the western sky
Reach to the blackness
Find a silver line
In a voice  I whisper
A candle in the night
Will carry all our dreams
On a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky
The clouds will move aside
And there will be the road
To all our dreams
And for any day that stings Two better days it brings Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us
Now the time has come
When all is said and done
We're back together on the road
It's time to fly
No more time to wait
You know it feels so great
Wearing leather on a horse of steel
I ride
I ain't waiting to get old
I'm running hot,  I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me
I don't care
I got my wheels,  I got my friends
We're on the road again
We're all crazy
Gonna ride until we die
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down
It's just another day
I got no money or big house
Just got life
I don't like to save, it's more fun to spend
If you like metal, you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard
Well, that's my wife
Don't try to understand me
My family never will
Had to punch my teacher out
Now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way, it's my decision
One more beer and heavy metal
And  I'm just fine
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
We are the undefeated
We're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel
Let's drink to riding steel
Living hard and riding fast
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest, so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal
Would we fall?
No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones
Into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together
Four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever
Till our kingdoms fall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power, drink to the sound Thunder and metal are shaking the ground Drink to your brothers who are never to fall We are brothers of metal, here in the hall Our hearts are filled with metal And masters, we have none And we will die for metal Metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power, drink to the sound Thunder and metal are shaking the ground Drink to your brothers who are never to fall We are brothers of metal, here in the hall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
In the beginning there was silence
And darkness, all across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burnt high in the sky
From down below, fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burnt
It's more than our religion
It's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal, we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
We believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
We're here tonight for heavy metal
Are you ready in the hall?
They have chosen us and
We have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal, one and all
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die

We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna
Never gonna die
Never gonna die
No
Some want to think hope is lost
See me stand alone
I can't do what others may want
Then  I'll have no home
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry
To all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage
Ride into the night
Battles are fought by those
With the courage to believe
They are won by those
Who find the hearts
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul
Will point the way to victory
If there's a fight, then  I'll be there
I'll be there
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry
To all who hope to fly
Lift your wings up high, my friend
Fearless to the end
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Ride into the night
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting is done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame
The time has come all training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting is done
We were born to win number 1

We were born to win number 1
I'm a stranger in town
And my gun's never cold
I'm gambler, so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead,  I won't step aside
Where trouble's waiting, well so am  I
I live for the fight, the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood  I spill
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast, live on the run
Stay alive, be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on  Boot  Hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast, live on the run
Stay alive, be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whiskey,  I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle, pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town, one more kill
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind, hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing
About heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see
That a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight
Through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown, a ring
The power of the man
Who would be king
The power of the man
Who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind
Knows nothing's what it seems
The melting of the soul
The wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will
By destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear
Of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live
Like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power
To fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged
All across the land
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Time to face the world
Let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and
Keep the dream in sight
For those who never try
They are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind
That comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king
We fight to stay alive
By the power of the will
The spirit to survive
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
All of the dreams held deep inside
Have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing
Is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man
Who would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
For the glory of the king
We fight to stay alive, fight
By the power of the will
The spirit to survive, fight
Across the gates of  Heaven
Beyond the gates of  Hell, fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and lived to tell
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free
To die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave
Of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness
To see without my sight
Walk among the living
Free of wrong and right
The power of the magic
The power of the spell
Not to serve in  Heaven
But one day rule in  Hell
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
This power's greater
Than love and of hate
Is this the power of will and of fate?
The power to kill, the power to feel
The power of blood
The triumph of steel
Greater than the power
Of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy
To fight and be the winner
The power of the  Demons
Spirits  I command
Always by my side
To serve the master's plan
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
None can fight the power
None can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death
Are carried there within
Call out to the power
Of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth
Be lord of all the light
Kill all those who stand against you
Look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh
As they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves
Then cast the final spell
Fly into the night and
One day meet in  Hell
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
When they see us
They will run for their lives
To the end, they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Here once again
There's a battle to fight
Gather together
For the sound and the might
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom
Fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood
That we gladly have shed
I now issue the call
Are you ready to fight?
Yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look
That you have in your eyes
You came here for metal
To fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom
Fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood
That we gladly have shed
I now issue the call
Are you ready to fight?
Yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look
That you have in your eyes
You came here for metal
To fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
On my steel
There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it
If you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom
Many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will
Always live inside us
And now, it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
So ring out loud for all the world to hear
From the sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the year
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Now is the time
We all must stand together
So raise your hands
Show them we are strong
Side by side, the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
Nessun dorma, nessun dorma . 
Tu pure, o  Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle
Che tremano d'amore
E di speranza
Ma il mio mistero e' chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun sapra', no, no
Sulla tua bocca lo diro'
Quando la luce splendera'
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera' il silenzio
Che ti fa mia
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero!
Vincero!
Vincero!
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero!
Vincero!
Vincero!

---  English translation ---
No one sleeps, no one sleeps
Even you,  Princess
In your cold room
Watch the stars
That tremble with love
And with hope
But my secret is hidden within me
My name no one shall know, no, no
On your mouth  I will speak it
When the light shines
And my kiss will dissolve the silence
That makes you mine
Vanish, o night!
Set, stars!
Set, stars!
At daybreak  I shall conquer!
I shall conquer!
I shall conquer!
I surrender my soul
Odin, hear my call
One day  I'll sit beside your throne
In  Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honour and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality, be mine
Call the witch to cast the ruins
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for  Heaven, not for  Hell
We are sons of  Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many  I'll send to the ground
Laughing as they die
We are sons of  Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Place my body on a ship
And burn it in the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkyries carry me
Take me to  Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Oh,  I wish,  I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away  Dixie land
Oh,  I wish,  I was in  Dixie away, away
In  Dixie land  I'll take my stand
To live and die in  Dixie
Dixie land where  I was born
Early  Lord, one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away  Dixie land
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials  Lord, will soon be over
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on
Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right, to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the metal sky
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us
But they will never win
We said we would return
And here we are again!
To bring them all destruction
Suffering, and pain
We are the hammer of the  Gods
We are thunder, wind, and rain!
There they wait in fear
With swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king
First, one should be a man
I call about and charge them all
With a life that is a lie
And in their final hour
They shall confess before they die!
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
If  I should fall in battle
My brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse, and weapons
Tell my family how  I died
Until then  I will be strong
I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way, will die by steel!
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Hands of doom are reaching out
To crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain
No time to run within
And these hands you see before you
Will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil
Your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the pounding
And the army of the night
By the hammer of  Thor
You now shall die
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
We are high atop a mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now, the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside
You can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and
Tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain
Not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die
High atop the mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now, the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside
You can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and
Tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain
Not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
But we'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
They'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
But they'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flames
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set,  I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back,  I never will return
Into the fire of  Hell  I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Army of the  Heavens, my army waits in  Hell
To battle on the earth for all the souls who fell
I will not go unto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until  I reach my home
Across the bridge of death
Beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness
Into the black of night
No road back,  I never will return
Into the fire of  Hell  I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Into the darkness  I command my soul
Never shall  I repent, never shall  I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath
My enemies all shall die
Die, die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Die, die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
When they come,  I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the  Heavens are moving
Soon, they will align
Thor,  God of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal, together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Ride on from  Hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth where none shall remain
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Ride on from  Hell into the sky
We'll fight until, fight until, fight until we die
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Fight
From the darkness  I walk into the light
From the day  I walk into the night
From the shadows  I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart  I will be strong
To the defenders of faith  I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
From the darkness  I walk into the light
From the day  I walk into the night
From the shadows  I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart  I will be strong
To the defenders of faith  I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
Let's all stand together
For the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
Let's all stand together
For the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
If you want to win tonight, say
I believe
Dreadful thunder, the storm's moving in
And judgement day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes, heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the sole descendant
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the air and the water
By the fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of death and destruction
To all that  I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of battle
I long to be free, so  I wait for a sign
I wait for a star to fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand that if  I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring death and destruction
To all that  I will kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Powers of the universe did sire a son
He was baptised by fire, water, earth and sky
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light
And he alone shall forever be known
As the king of kings
I enter this world
Born under a sign of infinite light
And here  I shall dwell
I now understand
All that  I am
Shall live in thy command
Voices of victory, all shout and proclaim
The kingdom of glory is mine
The raise of the will, our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of  Hell
My armies of fire await
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the earth,  Gods of thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the fight,  I own the right
To be the king of kings
My enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray  I will never appear
Their life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the  Demons that live in the wind
As my chariot drives in the storm
With the hot blood of battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and  I'll die by the sword
All the days of his life he walked without fear
All whose lives he touched were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and magic wind
The kingdom of the king
King of kings
King of kings
King of kings
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla
 waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
He is descended from giants
His father  Loki,  God of fire Is the sworn blood brother to  Odin himself
He rides across land, sea and air From the land of the living to the land of the dead
This eight-legged steed crosses eight points of the compass
From eight directions into eight dimensions
He is the bringer of the valiant dead
From the battlefield to  Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle Over land and sea Across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back  I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by  Valkyries, we valiant dead
To the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from  Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died, but never yielded
Faster than the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of  Asgard across the sky
To the world of  Gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war  God  Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Carry we who die in battle Over land and sea Across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
Odin's waiting
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men
As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of  Thor his friend
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To  Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
Brother to  Thor
And  Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns forever more
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To  Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
(repeat)
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show
And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do,  I am here for you
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain
A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens,  Huginn and  Muninn.  They circle the  Earth by day seeing all.  At night they report to him the world's tidings.  He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring.  At his side sit two wolves.  His weapons, a magic sword and a spear called  Gungnir.  They are carved with runes.  His eight legged horse  Sleipnir carries him over land sea and air.  The bringer of the valiant dead, the  Einherjar.  From the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye.  He was granted supreme wisdom.  He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.  Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.  Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.  Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.  In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.  He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.  He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of  Odin!
Here to the blaze  I wander
Through this black night  I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords did clash
Fallen by our axes, helmets smashed
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too,  I may fall
I will enter  Odin's hall
I will die, sword in hand
My name and my deeds
Will scorch the land
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Sons of  Odin, we four
By the hammer of  Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born, another shall fall
This day men will die
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Onward into the heart of the battle fought the sons of  Odin
Outnumbered many times, still they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells that once were bodies
But  Odin alone would choose the day they would enter  Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them the berserker rage
Now  Gods of men, they rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals, such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail  Gods of war
Deep into the heart of the battle they fought
Covered on all sides as all converged on them
Until the four could no longer be seen
As time passed  I feared them lost
Then slowly the armies separated
Many were dead
I saw the four
Each down on one knee
All stopped to watch and gaze upon them with a smile of victory
Before sending them into the ground
Then they rose together
To make a final stand
With their last bit of strength
They raised their arms into the air
Pointing blood stained weapons to the sky
They called upon the god of war and made ready to die
But  Odin would not call them this day to  Valhalla
Instead he sent thunder and lightning
To strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the  Berserker rage!
Now filled with that strength
The power of a thousand men was given them
No longer mortal
They were touched by the gods
This time when they took up the attack
Men fell not by tens
But by hundreds
By thousands
And when the smoke did clear
The four spoke the words
And the masses answered the response of the warrior's prayer
Gods of  War  I call you,  Gods of  War  I call you
My sword is by my side,  My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor,  I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride,  Free from all false pride
I will crack the whip,  I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail,  With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death,  Cover me with death
If  I should ever fail,  If  I should ever fail
Glory,  Glory, majesty, majesty, unity, unity
Hail,  Hail!  Hail,  Hail!  Hail!
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee, raise thy hand
We, the sons of  Odin await thy command
Born under the sign of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die!
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound!
Let thy  Valkyries fly!!
Down from the sky into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Today is the day we  Die in the fight
None shall remain to pass one more night
Now  Valhalla's calling us immortal
We are gods immortal!
We are  Gods  Of  War!!
Odin!
Here the fallen waits
To join thee
By thy side
Let  Valhalla's gates
Open wide.....
Born under the sign of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died!
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound!!
Let thy  Valkyries fly!!!
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Today is the day we  Die in the fight
None shall remain to pass one more night
Now  Valhalla's calling us immortal
We are gods immortal!
We are  Gods  Of  War!!
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Woooooa!
Wooooooa!
Woooooooa!
Wooooooooa!
Woooooooooa!
Woaaaa!
Wooooa!!!!
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
In the halls of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Speared, hung upside down
Nine days and nights
No food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death  I am king
For both do  I bring
By sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
A hero was he, touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died a man of honour
He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal
Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand, rest thy command
For  Odin's call was heard
Above them all
Thy name shall never die
Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge, death's no stranger
Blood and death lived on his sword
The  God of war, his only lord
Into the depths of  Hell
Go all, he fell
Take thy shield, take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them
When  Odin bid thee rise
For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the  Valkyries fly
As so it was by the hand of  Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of  Valhalla and into legend
Rise, brother, rise, pass  Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now, the son of  Odin rise
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We will die
Quit my job this morning, said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause  I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So  I walked outside into the streets
From a hall  I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so  I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother, said
My friends are over there
They call themselves immortals They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said
Hold your head up high
Raise your fists up in the air
Play metal louder than  Hell, louder than  Hell
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We would die
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We will die
Brothers, stand beside me
There's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching
They're marching on me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We would die
Riding on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sitting in leather, riding on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again
No, he won't
You were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
My social workers got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name
Yes, it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks run out next week
It won't be very long till  I'm back
On the streets again
Now, now you were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes,  I am
I'm gonna ride on you, baby
By moonlight, we ride
Ten thousand side by side
With swords drawn, held high
Our whips and armor shine
Hail to thee, our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gone are the days, when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's wake
The sense of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the battle, we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men die
We crossed a starlit sky
And still, no space and time
We'll catch the wind
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
