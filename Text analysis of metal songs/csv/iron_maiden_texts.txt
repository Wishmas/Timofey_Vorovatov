Walking through the city Looking oh-so pretty I've just got to find my way See the ladies flashing All their legs and lashes I've just got to find my way
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes With it open wide What you seeing, girl? Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it Can't you believe your eyes? It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Walking through the city Looking oh-so pretty I've just got to find my way See the ladies flashing All their legs and lashes I've just got to find my way
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes With it open wide What you seeing, girl? Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it Can't you believe your eyes? It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the...  Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... sky!
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the... (fire!)
Okay!
Just sixteen, a pickup truck Out of money, out of luck I've got nowhere to call my own Hit the gas, and here  I go
I'm running free, yeah I'm running free I'm running free, yeah Oh,  I'm running free
I spent the night in an  L. A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild,  I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free, yeah I'm running free I'm running free, yeah Oh,  I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey

Ow, ow!  Ow, ow!
Oh-woah, yeah!
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and  I know that you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now,  I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul And you know  I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Ooh
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the  Phantom of the  Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
The only place where you can dream Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here  I am,  I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh...
Stalks of light come from the ground
When  I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby...
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh...
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a fiver,  It's only for starters
And ten the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see love
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well,  Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well,  Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well,  Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
' Cause you're making love all day
Aww, 'cause you're making...
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making...
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see love

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed Dominance and persecution My mother was a queen
, 
my dad  I've never seen I was never meant to be
And now  I spend my time looking all around For a man that's nowhere to be found Until  I find him,  I'm never gonna stop searching I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
' Cause  I'm a wrathchild
Yeah,  I'm a wrathchild
Well,  I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Or  I know  I'll just go crazy
But now  I spend my time looking all around For a man that's nowhere to be found, ugh Until  I find him,  I'm never gonna stop searching I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
' Cause  I'm a wrathchild
Well,  I'm a wrathchild
Yeah,  I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Yeah!
I remember it as plain as day Although it happened in the dark of the night I was strolling through the streets of  Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then  I heard a piercing scream
And  I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all  I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Someone call the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me I never done nothing at all But  I got some blood on my hands Because everyone's shouting at me I can't speak  French so  I couldn't explain And like a fool  I started running away
Murder in the  Rue  Morgue
Someone call the  Gendarmes
Murder in the  Rue  Morgue
Am  I ever gonna be free?
And now  I've gotta get away from the arms of the law All of  France is looking for me I've gotta find my way across the border for sure Down the south to  Italy
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm never coming home
Well,  I made it to the border at last But  I can't erase the scene from my mind Anytime somebody stares at me, well I just start running blind
Well,  I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
' Cause  I know  I show the signs of
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Running from the arms of the law
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Am  I ever gonna be free?
It took so long and  I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should  I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If  I could go to somebody for help To get me out of trouble for sure
But  I know that it's on my mind That my doctor said  I've done it before
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm never going home
As  I lay here lying on my bed Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is,  I want to know
Please, won't you tell me?  It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away, yeah
But  I'm so tired of living I might as well end today

Oh, yeah!  Yeah!
Ow!  Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow!  Yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one,  I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
, ahahahahaha!
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how  I came to forsee, see, see, ahahaha!
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh  God help me what have  I done?! Ohh yeah,  I've done it again!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs Ooh look out,  I'm coming for you!
Hahahahahahaha!
O-oh!
Listen to me,  Lamia, listen to what  I've got to say I've got these feelings and they won't go away I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees Oh, help me,  Lamia, or  I'm sure  I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now  I know that  I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel  I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh,  Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia,  I've got this curse,  I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh...
Oh,  Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia,  I've got this curse,  I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh...
Thinking of an age old dream
Places  I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly Forever now  I can't think why My body tries to leave my soul Is it me,  I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness,  I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!

Drifting on
Yeah!
Longboats have been sighted And the evidence of war has begun
Many  Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields gleam in the sun
Call to arms, defend yourselves Get ready to stand and fight for your lives Judgement day has come around So be prepared, don't run, stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come, the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders pillaging Invaders looting
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand The  Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders fighting Invaders marauding
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground Severed limbs and fatal woundings, bloody corpses lay all around The smell of death and burning flesh, the battle-weary​ fight to the end
The  Saxons
 have been overpowered victims of the mighty  Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders raping Invaders plundering
He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, " Oblivion?  Well, it beckons us all"
Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're children of the damned Your backs' against the wall You turn into the light You're burning in the night You're children of the damned Like candles, watch them burn Burning in the light You'll burn again tonight Children of the damned

If you're feeling down, depressed and lonely I know a place where we can go ( Go)22  Acacia  Avenue
Meet a lady that  I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
You might even get in free
So any time you're down the  East  End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness? Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease?
Some day when you've reached the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any more beautiful wares to show anymore
22, the  Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the  Avenue
The way you walk, it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22, the  Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good, don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you, don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you, stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me
Woe to you, o'er  Earth and  Sea For the  Devil sends the beast with wrath Because he knows the time is short Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast For it is a human number Its number is six hundred and sixty-six
I left alone, my mind was blank I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind What did  I see?  Can  I believe That what  I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what  I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black, was no use holding back Cos  I just had to see, was someone watching me? In the mist, dark figures move and twist Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun,  Satan's work is done
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on,  I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But  I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me
I'm coming back,  I will return And  I'll possess your body and  I'll make you burn I have the fire,  I have the force I have the power to make my evil take its course
White man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creed He took our game for his own need We fought him hard, we fought him well Out on the plains we gave him hell But many came, too much for  Cree Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom, the stab in the back Women and children are cowards, attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes Hunting and killing's their game Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good  Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Shadows may hide you but also be your grave
You're running today, maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide?  How long till they come?
A rat in a trap, but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
In gangland, where the jail birds die
A knife at your throat, another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Dead men
Gangland
Murder
Gangland, tell no tales
I'm waiting in my cold cell 
when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cos at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error? Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that  I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when  I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am  I crying? After all,  I'm not afraid of dying
Don't  I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, " God be with you"
If there's a  God, why has  He let me go?
As  I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near,  I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that  I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah
Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of  Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone Freezing up the fires Sunrise has gone Numbing our desires Sunrise has gone Sunrise has gone
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Sunrise has gone Freezing up the fires Sunrise has gone Numbing our desires
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
" Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun
It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still, they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian  Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare
O,  God of earth and altar Bow down and hear our cry Our earthly rulers falter Our people drift and die The walls of gold entomb us The swords of scorn divide Take not thy thunder from us Take away our pride
Just a babe in a black abyss No reason for a place like this The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go A clever path for the fools who know The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind, you'll see The venom tears my spine The eyes of the  Nile are opening, you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss As the eye of the sun rose on her lips Moonlight catches silver tears that  I cry
So we lay in a black embrace And the seed is sown in a holy place And  I watched and  I waited for the dawn, oh
The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the  Nile are opening, you'll see
Go!
Bind all of us together Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you, oh
It is you
As the sun breaks above the ground An old man stands on the hill As the ground warms to the first rays of light A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun, yeah
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears Looks the old man in the eye As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd" In the name of  God, my father,  I'll fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun
Yeah!
Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly...
Fly as high as the sun
Yeah, another prophet of disaster Who says this ship is lost Another prophet of disaster Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions Afflicting us with fear Predicting war for millions In the hope that one appears

You'll take my life, but  I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but  I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke
 
and horse's breath
As  I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the  Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the  Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away We won't live to fight another day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a  Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and  I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as  I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as  I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear,  I draw my parting groan
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Take a look in the pool and what do you see? In the dark depths there, faces beckoning me Can't you see them?  It's plain for all to see They were there, oh  I know you don't believe me
Oh,  I've never felt so strange
But  I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think  I'm off of my head You don't say but it's in your eyes instead Hours  I spend out just gazing into that pool Something draws me there,  I don't know what to do
Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay
Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away And  I feel that  I'm weaker every day Somehow  I know  I haven't long to go Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now,  I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares coming all the time
Nightmares will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and  I know what  I have to do I must take you down there to look at them too Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool Can't you see?  Not just me, they want you too
Oh, we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares, forever calling me Nightmares, now we rest in peace
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire And the wolves they howled into the night As they fought a vicious angry battle To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away That the flame of life had burnt and died Didn't know the sparks that made the fire Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts In the search to find another fire To regain the power of light and heat
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
You killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct,  Animal supreme
By 16, you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind You came at last - nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones Take you and your blade and break you both in two - Break you both in two
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal

He is the  King of all the land In the  Kingdom of the sands Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the  Fremen In a land amongst the stars Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a  King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet  Dune
Body water is your life And without it that you would die In the desert the planet  Dune, oh!
Without a still suit you would fry On the sands so hot and dry In a world called  Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice The sand riders and the mice That they call the ' Muad' Dib'
He is the  Kwizatz  Haderach He is born of  Caladan And will take the  Gom  Jabbar
He has the power to foresee Or to look into the past He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see, he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme True leader of men
And when the time
For judgment's at hand
Don't fret, he's strong
He'll make a stand
' Gainst evil and fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying Rolling, turning, diving, going in again Running, scrambling, flying Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly Fly to live
, 
aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away Roll over, spin round to come in behind them Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten  M E-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our  Spitfires to face them Heading straight for them  I press down my guns
Rolling, turning, diving Rolling, turning, diving, doing it again Rolling, turning, diving Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly Fly to live
, 
aces high!
Kill for gain, or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout " Let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers"
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time  Belsen feast, yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night
As a young boy chasing dragons With your wooden sword so mighty You're  St.  George or you're  David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
He threw down a glove, you made the mistake Of picking it up, now you're gone The choosing of guns or fighting with swords The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for the pleasure Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for the pleasure Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for your life
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The  Angel of  Death hears your last breath Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour Fought for the splendour Fought for the pleasure Oh, oh, fought for the honour Fought for the splendour Fought to the death
Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and  I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
Questions are a burden And answers a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number,  I'm a name
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again, yeah
I'm back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village and  I'm back in the village and  I'm back in the village
Again
Into the  Abyss  I'll fall, 
the eye of  Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this  Temple
Enter the risen  Osiris, risen again
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
When  I was living this lie, fear was my game People would worship and fall Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and Red wine for the one to succeed me For  He is a man and a  God And  He will die too
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave
I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
Now  I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved - For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell I'll strike from the grave
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death...
Hear the rime of the ancient  Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three Mesmerises one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by a spell and the  Mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow, fog flies on the  Albatross
Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the  Albatross follows on
The  Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm
The  Albatross begins with its vengeance A terrible curse
, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the  Mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
" Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"
" There," calls the  Mariner, " There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"
See, onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two
Death and she  Life-in- Death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the  Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she,  Life-in- Death She lets him live, her chosen one
" One after one by the star-dogged  Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And  I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one."
The curse, it lives on in their eyes The  Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he
And by the light of the  Moon
He prays for their beauty, not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The  Albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain!  Hahahaha!
Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the  Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long-dead bodies
Form their own light and the  Mariner's left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The  Pilot's boat, his son, and the  Hermit Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
And the  Hermit shrieves the  Mariner of his sins
The  Mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell this tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made
And the  Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on
I've been trying, trying so hard
I've been crying, crying in the dark
Don't forsake me, the time of mine is near
Don't ever break me and the world that brought me here
Sick and lonely, waiting for the dawn
Sick and lonely, wondering what to do
Can you hear me, when  I say to you
" You give me your hand,  I'll give mine to you"?
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight shows me
I will take ten steps to see
Forty leaves  I pay for freedom
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight calls you
Take a step and you will see
We all need a quick solution
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
Free!
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight shows me
I will take ten steps to see
Forty leaves  I pay for freedom
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
If you had the time to lose An open mind and time to choose Would you care to take a look Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Can  I tempt you, come with me Be  Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If  I said  I'd take you there Would you go, would you be scared?
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me Safe as any soul can be Honestly, just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing You try to hide your deepest sins Of all the things that you've done wrong
And  I know where you belong
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Make you an offer you can't refuse You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds, oh
From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things  I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is?
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
Out in the street somebody's crying Out in the night the fires burn Maybe tonight somebody's crying Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere  I hear a voice that's calling Out in the dark there burns a dream You got to hope when you are falling To find the world that you have seen
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
It's madness The sun don't shine on the sea of madness There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness, when all you see
Can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go
Out in the night somebody's crying Out in the night the fires burn Maybe tonight somebody's crying Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
Of madness, of madness
Of madness, of madness
Of madness, of madness
Can't understand what is happening to me This isn't real, this is only a dream But  I never have felt No  I never have felt this way before I'm looking down on my body below I lie asleep in the midst of a dream Is it now could it be that the angel Of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone And it's my soul and  I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the  Earth below And  Hell itself is my only foe' Cause  I've no fear of dying I'll go when  I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays I see a tunnel,  I stand amazed At all of the people Standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness  I'll be led Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish  I knew this was only just a nightmare
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Take my hand,  I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand,  I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth,  I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
My body tingles,  I feel so strange
I feel so tired,  I feel so drained
And  I'm wondering if  I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or  Heaven or  Hell? Maybe  I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to  Earth So could this be the hour of my rebirth? Or have  I died or will  I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Tough of the track with the wind And the rain that's beating down on your back Your heart's beating loud And goes on getting louder And goes on even more Till the sound is ringing in your head With every step you tread And every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop Gotta win, gotta run till you drop Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer You're over halfway there But the miles, they never seem to end As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere It seems so futile
Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes? You reach the final stretch Ideals are just a trace You feel like throwing the race It's all so futile
Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner
Was many years ago that  I left
Home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me
That all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day  I scan horizon, sea and sky My spirit wanders endlessly Until the day will dawn and friends From home discover why Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone And men again they came that way To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying Where it fell on that day Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
What became of the man that started All are gone and their souls departed Left me here in this place, so all alone
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
What became of the man that started All are gone and their souls departed Left me here in this place, so all alone
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land Land of ice and snow Trapped inside this prison...
When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
' Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment
In time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realize you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
' Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment
In time is surreal
' Cause you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
" My son, ask for thyself another kingdom For that which  I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east In a part of ancient  Greece
In an ancient land called  Macedonia
Was born a son to  Philip of  Macedon The legend, his name was  Alexander
At the age of nineteen He became the  Macedon  King
And he swore to free all of  Asia  Minor
By the  Aegean  Sea in 334  B. C He utterly beat the armies of  Persia
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great Became a legend amongst mortal men
King  Darius the third Defeated fled  Persia
The  Scythians fell by the river  Jaxartes
Then  Egypt fell to the  Macedon  King as well
And he founded the city called  Alexandria
By the  Tigris river He met  King  Darius again And crushed him again in the battle of  Arbela
Entering  Babylon And  Susa, treasures he found Took  Persepolis, the capital of  Persia
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great Became a god amongst mortal men
A  Phrygian  King had bound a chariot yoke And  Alexander cut the ' Gordian knot' And legend said that who untied the knot He would become the master of  Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide The  Macedonian learned mind Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for  Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side Alexander's army line by line They wouldn't follow him to  India Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great
He died of fever in  Babylon

(" Don't think it's quite bloody funny at all!
Don't know why you're laughing about!")
Life in the city living in  L. A
Is a long way from  Huddersfield town
The back of the  Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him cwazy
Wugby and cwicket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says " Wodney come home"
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on  Hollywood  Hills
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own  Hot  Rod on wheels
(" No,  I'm not!")
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The  Nautilus rusts in the yard (*grunts*)
But for  Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in  L. A (*grunts*)
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills (*grunts*)
He's winning at poker and playing the  Joker
And he always cheats when he deals (" I don't!  No!")
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
Looks down on  Hollywood  Hills
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own  Hot  Rod on wheels
" Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is  Rodney.  I'm immensely strong
When  I were a lad,  I could lift up five
Navvies on an end of a shovel
The reason  I never took up martial arts is because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
That  I came into contact with it
I was phenomenally strong
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is  Huddersfield
That's why  I don't live there anymore
I live in  Los  Angeles
It's great!...  I think"
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born
(" Bloody well right!")
A bear with a sore head we don't mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
(" Bloody watch it!")
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast (*fart*)
Your problem  Rodney's  L. A

I don't...  I'm not in it for the money!
I like it here, the sun shines all night!"
*throwing up sounds* *fart* *mumbling*
It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word  I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away
You're fighting your friends
You're wearing everyone
But it never ends
You're wearing me out
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Don't get me wrong
You always apologise
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word  I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to  Hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one The fallen angel watching you Babylon, the scarlet whore I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son Kill him now and save the young ones Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own,  Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones,  I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand As a suicide you shall be damned And if you try to save your soul I will torment you, you shall not grow old With every second and passing breath You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When  Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit You'll beg forgiveness and none  I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat To clothe you in the night A lucky escape for you, young man But  I see you damned in endless night
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child Moonchild, take my hand tonight
Infinite dreams,  I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat Scared to fall asleep again In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing,  I cannot move Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will  I transcend? Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think There's more to this,  I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that  I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would  I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me,  I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth Of what's out there to have the proof? And find out just which side you're on Where would you end? In  Heaven or in  Hell?
Help me Help me to find my true self without seeing the future Save me Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow!
There's got to be just more to it than this Or tell me why do we exist I'd like to think that when  I die I'd get a chance, another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again and again
Can  I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if  I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know  I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man I said " Don't lie, don't say you don't know" I say " You'll pay for this mischief In this world or the next" Oh, and then he fixed me with a freezing glance And the hellfires raged in his eyes He said " You wanna know the truth son? Lord,  I'll tell you the truth Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see
" Listen to me," said the prophet
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see Said you're too blind to see
Can  I play with madness?
Love is a razor and  I walked the line on that silver blade Slept in the dust with his daughter Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence And  I will pray for her,  I will call her name out loud I would bleed for her,  If  I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, 
the book of life opens before me
And  I will pray for you, some day  I may return Don't you cry for me, beyond is where  I learn
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil The evil that men do The evil, the evil The evil that men do
Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Oh
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Oh
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Oh, oh
Then they watch the progress he makes The  Good and the  Evil, which path will he take? Both of them trying to manipulate The use of his powers, before it's too late Oh
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Today is born the seventh one Born of woman, the seventh son And he in turn of a seventh son He has the power to heal He has the gift of the second sight He is the chosen one So it shall be written So it shall be done
Now that  I know that the right time has come My prediction will surely be true The impending disaster, it looms And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me? Is it so hard to understand? That  I am the real seventh son Your life or death on me depends
( Suffering and pain)  Impending disaster
( Souls crying)  The  Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
( Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits)
I'll take your life in my hands Your fate, your fortune's in my vision Heed what  I say and you'll see what will be Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel  I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that  I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future,  I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know  I'm the one who is cursed?
( Purgatory beckons)  Souls lost forever
( Life after death)  Or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
( Now  Lucifer laughs,  Hell awaits)
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late
Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now? Is this a vision or normality  I see before my eyes?
I wonder why,  I wonder how That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day I feel a strength an inner fire But  I'm scared  I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind See the truth and see your lies But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying
And be reborn again?
The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man My future it is revealed Time, it waits for no man My fate is sealed
If  I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets,  I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So  I think  I'll leave you With your bishops and your guilt So until the next time Have a good sin
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Seven deadly sins Seven ways to win Seven holy paths to hell Seven downward slopes Seven bloodied hopes Seven are your burning fires Seven your desires
At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit's lost
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but he doesn't care
Doesn't care if lives or if he dies
The general commanding
Defending what we feel
The troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If  God is in his heaven
How come there's no heaven here?
In  God's name, they used weapons
For the massacre
At a point below zero
The sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead beneath the sand

Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole

Black  Bart tried most anything
Black  Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see

Black  Bart's lookin' to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer
You could dance around his pole in  May
That's a maypole
Black  Bart's coming
Now  Black  Bart's gone
Black  Bart did it so  I wrote this song
Whatever and however
In and out or several at a time ( Mmm yes!)

Believe in me and send no money I died on the cross, that ain't funny But my so-called friends they're making me a joke They missed out what  I said like  I never spoke
They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey
Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah Making holy smoke
Jimmy  Reptile and all his friends Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers,  Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
Till the  T V queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth,  I've lived in sin And  I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
Holy smoke, holy smoke There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke, smells good
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When  Noah built his  Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a  Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail
Holy smoke, holy smoke Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke. yeah Holy smoke
There are times when  I've wondered
And times when  I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when  I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would  I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah
When  I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me Just what my life means Walking a long road Never reaching the end
God, give me the answer to my life God, give me the answer to my dreams God, give me the answer to my prayers God, give me the answer to my being
Ah ha!
When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet One way ticket out of here
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
In the cities, in the streets There's a tension you can feel The breaking strain is fast approaching Guns and riots
The politicians gamble And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
Mmm, what ho!
Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive? And some of us are here just so that we'll die?
How come the bullet hits the other guy?
Do we have to try and reason why?
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day Or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the  Lord above Or the  Devil himself come to give you a shove?
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come, a  Hell to face mankind
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
Now the contract's out They've put the word about I'm coming after you
It's not the money  I make It's the thrill of the chase And  I'm coming after you
I watch your every move Study the things you do And the pattern of your ways I watch the way you walk I hear your telephone talk I want to understand the way you think
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, better watch out Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, better watch out
Assassin, assassin Assassin, assassin
Ha!  Ha ha ha…
I'm in a cold, cold sweat I taste the smell of death I know the moment's getting closer And as you walk to the light I feel my hands go tight Excitement running though my veins
I've got you in my sights I've got you dead to rights The trigger's waiting for my finger I feel adrenaline rush It's just the final touch And you can kiss your ass goodbye
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Assassin
The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground
Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of  Hell and the  Devil don't care
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die
A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim, fool for the day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
The lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to  Davy  Jones
Every man for himself, you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
Ah, in two more weeks, dead like the rest
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
I got the keys to view at number twenty-two
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature?  What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
She's tied up, she can't come to the phone You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know  I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I’ve got those…
Hooks in you
Mother  Russia,
 how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow From the trees the snowflakes drifting Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow
Mother  Russia,
 poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
Mother  Russia,
 dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past
Mother  Russia,
 dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?
Look inside your head and find, tell me now and it's all in your mind
Look inside your head and find a way deep inside and it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Revolution, air pollution,  Chairman  Mao  Tse  Tung is in your mind
" But he's dead pal...  He's not very well anyway..."
A new day breaking-people hating
Love's a dream and it's all in your mind
S O L O
Segregation, preservation, politicians all are in your mind
Pewter suta,  Karma  Sutra, even  Blanckenheimer's in your mind
Yes...
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that  I like about you, but  I like it a lot
Won't let me hold you, let me feel your loving charms
Communication  Breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane!
Hey, girl,  I got something  I think you ought to know
Hey, babe,  I wanna tell you that  I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, cause  I like your charms
Communication  Breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane!

The price he paid for money

One yawn ah, two yawn ah

Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, madman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie, bonne nuit
Remember that song called kill me
A lecture on political chicanary
Of peoples rape, recorded on tape
Brought shame to the presidency
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Remeber that song kill me
Once used by a man from  Gallilea
He had nothing to lose, he was  King of the  Jews
Secured his place in history
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateur
The news is read, the poison's spread
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie
Vick played his part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When hollow lead bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of
Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt Making you money From slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers Investing our lives In your schemes and your powers
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place
The serpent is crawling inside of your ear He says you must vote For what you want to hear Don't matter what's wrong As long as you're alright Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)

Be quick or be dead! Be quick!
She fell in love with his greasy machine She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the  Beast before But she left there wanting more, more, more
But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
" I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh
But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the  Devil's bend
The  Beast and  Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Yes ah, yeah like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr.  Murray
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity
" Get on your  M11, get on your bike!" Ha ha ha ha ha!
Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow But it's not the fear Cause  I'd rather go now Trying to visualize The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground
When it comes to the time Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time We'll be ready to die
God, let us go now And finish what's to be done Thy  Kingdom come Thy shall be done on  Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves The reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?
But how can we let them go on this way? The reign of terror, corruption must end And we know deep down There's no other way No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night
You can feel so much
In the heat of the night
I scream " Don't touch!"
I remember a time
When we used and abused
We fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time
We thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night, bodies aflame
We live in fever
I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares
Till somebody famous dies
I remember a time
When we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time
We thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night, bodies aflame
We live in fever
We live in fever
Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key
To what you want to be
You don't get a say
The majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
Till the day you die
Hahahahaha!
I hear your silent heartbeat
I hear your silent cries
Oh your just in lies and lies
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares
Till somebody famous dies
Keep telling lies and lies and lies...
A A A E E E E
-hahaha
I remember the time
When we used and abused
Ah, it was just lies
I remember the time
We thought that passion was free
And it was just lies and lies and lies...
Heat of the night
A A A A E E E E E E
We live in fever, we live in fever
We live in fever
Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key
To what you want to be
You don't get a say
The majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
Till the day you die
Maybe one day  I'll be an honest man Up 'til now  I'm doing the best  I can Long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset Sunrise to sunset
Dream on brothers, while you can Dream on sisters,  I hope you find the one All of our lives, covered up quickly By the tides of time
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters,  I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Sands are flowing and the lines Are in your hand
In your eyes  I see the hunger and the
Desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
On a cold  October morning As frost lay on the ground Waiting to make my move I made no sound Waiting for the mist To cover all around I carefully picked my time Then took the wall
I'm sick and tired of running The hunger and the pain A stop to look about Then off again
Being at the wrong place And at the wrong time Suspected of a hit That was my crime
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving  onwards Always on the run Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
Even if  I find them And get to clear my name I know that things can never be the same
But if  I ever prove
My innocence someday
I've got to get them all to make them pay
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and  I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery, yeah
He's got your chains of misery
There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says you're damned and you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He's felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
It's only love that holds the key
To your heart
It's only love
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
Now  I'm here, can you see me?
' Cause  I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me, 'cause  I'm here
Here  I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place  I'd been to
Only in my dreams before
In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
' Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
Through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?
Thought not
Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say
In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now
In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
Looking in?
You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
It's true
You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does
Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?
There are some who're wise
There are some who are born naïve
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?
As for me, well,  I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But  I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case
Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?
You know  I feel so elated
' Cause  I'm about to find it out
And when  I know all the answers
Maybe then  I'll come back
To fill you in
You, don't be alarmed now
If  I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
One day
Lights out, we live in a world of darkness No doubt, everything's up for sale We sleep, all of the world is burning We pray to  God for a better deal
Nothing is sacred Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?  Can  I go now?
Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide
Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory Come home, meat in a plastic sack
Fall down, pray to your  God for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean
Nothing's sacred Back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?  Is that it now?
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams
Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide
The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool Who are you kidding being that cool?
Trying to break away from running with the pack But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back
You're a weekend warrior When you're one of the crowd But it's over Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now
You're not so brave the way you behave It makes you sick, gotta get out quick It's all bravado when you're out with your mates It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins The adrenalin's high Feel the tension Maybe someone will die
Someone will die
Someone will die
Maybe someone will die
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
You've gotta get out, gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why
It's hard to say why you got involved Just wanting to be part Just wanting to belong
To belong
To belong
To belong, yeah
A weekend warrior lately A weekend warrior sometimes A weekend warrior maybe, you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore

What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
On  Monday
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe, you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior 
maybe, you were never like that at all
I am a man who walks alone And when  I'm walking a dark road At night or strolling through the park When the light begins to change I sometimes feel a little strange A little anxious when it's dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look, at the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you ever been alone at night Thought you heard footsteps behind And turned around and no-one's there? And as you quicken up your pace You find it hard to look again Because you're sure there's someone there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
When  I'm walking a dark road I am a man who walks alone
Vic  Vella:

There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, int' he.  He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and  I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself.  He was just going by the at the end of the boots.  He said " I'm fucking going,  I'm going!  Just lower the fucking forklift quick!"  And he grabbed hold of it, so  I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it.  Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

She's got an arse like coal tip
She's got tits just like hot air balloons - and  I mean the  Hindenburg!
She's the biggest girl,  I'm gonna get there soon
Yeah, you know what  I mean
She's got love when you want it
But she never lets go when you get it
You disappear inside, you're never seen again... lost forever
She's the biggest girl of all but  I'm gonna get there soon
Alright, here we go...
Should be some kind of guitar solo here...
Well  I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
I don't think she was available, she was made a conference stall
I met her in a bar, she was, she was propping up the wall
In fact she was nailed to it
I gotta admit (?) babe... let's get down to it baby!
She had a brain like a sheep-dip
She got love like a cesspit on your mind
She was a big girl, she was big
And  I mean she was big, she was fucking huge!
Enormous!
You could have sailed the  Hindenburg through her legs and never even have landing permission!
One more!
Oh we sailed across the ocean you and me
I looked like a flea on the back of a sperm whale
Oh yeah,  I was waving a match inside the  Albert  Hall!
Eleven saintly shrouded men Silhouettes stand against the sky One in front with a cross held high Come to wash my sins away
Standing alone in the wind and rain Feeling the fear that is growing Sensing the change in the tide again Brought by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
Why then is  God still protecting me
Even when  I don't deserve it?
Though  I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance
Why am  I meant to face this alone? Asking the question time and again Praying to  God won't keep me alive Inside my head, feel the fear start to rise
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes There'll be penance to pay when it's  Judgment  Day And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away
The sign of the cross The name of the rose
A fire in the sky The sign of the cross
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my  God'll lay my soul to rest
The sign of the cross The name of the rose
A fire in the sky The sign of the cross
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
The sign of the cross
Lost the love of heaven above Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away
I don't care for this world anymore
I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening
I've found that  I like this living in danger
Living on edge it feels, it makes us feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong It's reality
Killing so we survive
Wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide We've got to get away
I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality
I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
The freeway is jammed, and it's backed up for miles The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be What we deserve we just don't get, you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven?  Are they looking down?
' Cause nothing is fair, just you look around
Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down
He's sick of waiting, of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free, you just live by your wits
Once, he built missiles, a nation's defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city, he leaves in his wake A glimpse of the future: a cannibal state
Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down
The freeway is jammed, and it's backed up for miles The car is an oven and baking is wild

After the war and now That they've sent us homeward I can't help but feel that  I'm on my own
No one can see just what this conflict Has done to the minds of the men Who are on their way home
I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can  I face the torment alone?
The vivid scenes
And all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light
People say, " Don't worry"
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares, they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And  I'm feeling trancelike all the time
I hear voices in my head
Could  I really be going crazy?
In the night, the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die?
When you laugh, are you really crying?
You're not sure what's real anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore

Sometimes,  I wake I feel that my spirit's broken I wonder if  I've the strength... carry on Carry on
All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as  I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears  I never faced
Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time,  I won't wake
Weakness  I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell
It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To shadows of the past
Take a breath and  I scream, " Attack"
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Oh, oh
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled
Warhorse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
Once, a ploughman hitched his team
Here, he sowed his little dream
Now bodies, arms, and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades, dead or dying, lie
I'm left alone asking why
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Lord, is it over when the battles are done?
After the war and no one has won
I'm just a soldier
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Oh...
A lonely cry for help preaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to  God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when  I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life
You're searching in the dark Clutching at straws to find a way You take the  Tarot cards and throw them to the wind
You question your beliefs, your inner thoughts Your whole existence And if there is a  God, then answer if you will And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place Tell me if  I'll ever rest in peace
If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all?
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong?
All of my life,  I have believed Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me All of my life,  I have believed Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah!
All of my life now,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven awaits for me
All of my life now,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven awaits for me
Yeah!
All of my life,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah
Yeah!
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
For a week,  I have been waiting Still,  I am only in  Saigon The walls move in a little closer I feel the jungle call me on
Every minute,  I get weaker While, in the jungle, they grow strong What  I wanted was a mission And for my sins, they gave me one They brought it up just like room service' Cause everyone gets what they want And when that mission was all over I'd never want another one
Oh, oh
I know,  Captain, that you've done this work before We've got a problem, you can help us all,  I'm sure The colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound You'll take a  P B R upriver, track him down
There's a conflict in every human heart And the temptation is to take it all too far In this war, things get so confused But there are some things which cannot be excused
He's acting like a  God—an insane lunatic
Your mission—
terminate with extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Here  I am, the knife in my hand And now  I understand why the genius must die Now  I stand alone in the darkness With his blood upon my hands Where sat the warrior, the poet Now lie the fragments of a man
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
I've looked into the heart of darkness
When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see?
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self-belief or be satisfied?
Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else?
Is there something that you'd rather be?
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
And your self-respect, what can you expect?
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
Are you scared to look inside your mind?
Are you worried just at what you'll find?
Do you really want to face the truth?
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose?
Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think?
Are you strong enough to release the guilt?
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
Have you heard on the news?
Another let-off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the bad man?
What's the matter these days?
No one has the courage to put them away
Nobody has any faith
' Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
When  I remember back the memories of yesterday
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses doors were open
No had to care; those days are gone
Those days are gone
Those days are gone
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care
It must be the cynic in me
But  I don't really like things now
The violence, the attitudes
Aggression that you see every day
A sick society looks the other way
Yeah
There are no marks upon a man
That can say he's good or bad
No label and no telltale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
When you look into their eyes
You don't know what they hide
No label and no telltale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
" Ignorance is bliss," is that the reason
We cannot read another's mind?
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each other's heads
Would we all be driven mad?
Would we all be dead?
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
Sometimes when  I feel the anger
Sometimes when  I'm all alone
Sometimes when  I feel surrounded
Like all of the doors are closed
I feel like  I've been a prisoner
I feel like  I've been a fool
Let people try to judge me
When they're not in my shoes
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
Some people are only happy
When they can watch you fail
And to them, every day is
Another coffin nail
I think that  I've found the answer
I think that, at last,  I know
We've only got one lifetime
So make your life your own
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
I live my way
I live my way
I live my way
Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I have sailed to many lands Now  I make my final journey
On the bow  I stand West is where  I go
Through the night  I plough Still my heart, calculate and pray As the compass swings, my will is strong I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But  I know, but  I know, but  I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks The sirens call my name Lash my hands onto the helm Blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now
As sunrise comes, the darkness left behind
For eternity  I follow on, there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But  I know, but  I know, but  I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset, they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
Dying swans, twisted wings Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life In this garden of fear
I have seen many things in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home
Wilderness, house of pain Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind, dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see, it's not real Those who know will not tell All is lost, sold your souls To this brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
Dragon  Kings, dying  Queens Where is salvation now?
Lost my life, lost my dreams Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned In this brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
Dying  Swans, twisted wings Bring this savage back home
If you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father  I see And in a movement he beckons to me And in a moment the memories are all that remain And all the wounds are reopen again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
There are times when  I feel  I'm afraid for the world
There are times  I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now?  Is it really happening?
Don't know why  I feel this way Have  I dreamt this time, this place? Something vivid comes again into my mind And  I think  I've seen your face Seen this room, been in this place Something vivid comes again into my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have  I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true The dream is true, the dream is true
Think  I've heard your voice before
Think  I've said these words before
Something makes me feel  I just might lose my mind
Am  I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that  I have lost my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realisation
That  I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
I get up, put on the light Dreading the oncoming night Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again Nothing that  I contemplate Nothing that  I can compare To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors Lost in a paradox Lost and time is spinning Lost, a nightmare  I retrace Lost, a hell that  I revisit Lost, another time and place Lost, a parallel existence Lost, a nightmare  I retrace
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
Azazel's beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the only one
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen  Angel but  I've risen again
And the power is inside me,  I've decided to pray
As  I wait for  Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and  I wait for the day
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the only one
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own

All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Yeah
Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you, they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you will die and live again
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius
Out of the silent planet Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of  Gods Of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty The punishment is death for all who live The punishment is death for all who live
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you Before you know the crime, it's all too late Before you know the crime, it's all too late
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what, we'll never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate
