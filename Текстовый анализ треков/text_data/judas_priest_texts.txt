Faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
Rides the  Metal  Monster, breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
Planets devastated, mankind's on its knees A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel Evil's going under deadly wheels
He is the  Painkiller This is the  Painkiller Oh!
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave Nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave With mankind resurrected, forever to survive Returns from  Armageddon to the skies
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
Wings of steel  Painkiller
Deadly wheels  Painkiller
Ah!
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
Pain!  Pain!  Killer!  Killer!
Pain!  Pain!  Killer!  Killer!
Can't stop the  Painkiller
Pain!

Like wild fire comes roaring
Mad whirlwind burning the road
Black thunder, white lightning
Speed demons cry
The  Hell  Patrol
The  Hell  Patrol
Night riders, death dealers
Storm bringers tear up the ground
Fist flying, eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The  Hell  Patrol
The  Hell  Patrol
Brutalize you, neutralize you
Going to go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you, pulverize you
Going to cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Chrome  Masters, steel  Warriors
Soul  Stealers ripping out hearts
They're  Devil  Dogs
The  Hell  Patrol
The  Hell  Patrol

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings
 that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone  I walk through fire
Till  I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bulletproof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future Writings on the wall Legend in my lifetime Stories will recall
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

Something's calling in the night
Electric madness roars in sight
Heat is rising, blazing fast
Hot and evil, feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Raging fury, wired for sound
Nitro bombshell shakes the ground
High and mighty rips the air
Piercing laser, burning glare
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Temperature is boiling, magnifying might
Feeding like a virus, flashing light
Imminent collision, shockwaves all around
Generating energy, screams so loud
It's coming, meltdown
Start running, countdown
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown

Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
" Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant As they hoped it would Souls ascend to heaven While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
He's going to get you
He's going to get you
Beware of the beast
Night crawler
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you
Night crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you


You mesmerize slowly Till  I can't believe my eyes Ecstasy controls me What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But  I still feed the flame
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But  I still feed the flame
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Arousing me now
With a sense of desire
Possessing my soul
Until my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
You're possessing me
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember
One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire, one shot at glory
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death, we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember
One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire, one shot at glory
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember

I still hear the battle cry I still see the banners fly

Where would you be without music?
You would be nowhere at all
We wouldn't be here doing this now
If you weren't having a ball
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Not even the pink or white noise?
Well, thankfully we've got the license
To have us some fun with the boys
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way
The melody line's fascinating
The rhythm is something divine
It sends our adrenaline racing
To see you all moving so fine
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way

Man-eating momma, steam-driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messing, all-in wrestling
Is one of her pride and joys
She's a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two-faced liar, full of fire
But  I know the flame is mine
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can

You can take her if you want her you can

Got no silver for my pocket
Got no pillow for my head
And the winter it gets stronger
Got to ease my aching head
In the morning when  I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And  I wonder if  I'm dying
Or  I'll go out
Go out of my mind

I still get this, awful feeling
When the snow falls, to the ground
It still sends my, senses reeling
Telling winter, come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when  I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lying fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control  I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheating bitch here's what  I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy,  I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no  I've finished with you, your time is through
You are a cheater
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go
This could be our last show
Changing dreams changing schemes
Never
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should  I give sorrow, or turn around and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and  I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on
I,  I,  I,  I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open-minded, but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said  I was there
Lead to positions by stern-faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments  I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle, we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day
Is this the way that you get your fun
Slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob
You make me sick getting paid for murder
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds
Because you won't go to hell
Take your medal, wear it now with pride
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside


I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here  I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice  I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Now  I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over  Washington  Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause  I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes,  I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust

Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection
Takes another drink or two Things look better when she's through
Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new
Takes another drink or two Things look better when she's through
You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough,  I've had enough, good  God, pluck me
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine, she was mine
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Changes
Changes
Changes
Changes
Victim of changes
No, no, no
No

You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In  London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when  I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when  I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the  Ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if  I'm near
I'm sly and  I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for "the  Ripper"
Or if you like " Jack the  Knife"
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream at the sight
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the  Ripper
The  Ripper
The  Ripper

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds He could control our sense of time We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried Everyone was in peace of mind
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past Just seemed to vanish in thin air
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free
We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try


Behold 'tis  I the commander
Whose grip controls you all
Resist me not, surrender
I'll no compassion call
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Your very lives are held within my fingers
I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things who belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since  Tyrant was enthroned
I listen not to sympathy Whilst ruler of this land Withdraw your feeble aches and moans Or suffer smite from this my hand
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since  Tyrant was enthroned
My legions 
faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you
Shall scream as you are sought
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall

Mercenary battalions
Are poised to strike us down
Terminations conquest
Upon us now full-grown
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Devastation hungers
She waits to leap to earth
Imminent liquidation
Before the grand rebirth
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Sin after sin  I have endured Yet the wounds  I bear are the wounds of love
Frantic mindless zombies
Grab at fleeting time
Lost in cold perplexion
Waiting for the sign
Generations tremble
Clinging face to face
Helpless situation
To end the perfect race
Flashing senseless sabres
Cut us to the ground
Eager for the lifeblood
Of all who can be found
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Slice to the left, slice to the right
None to retaliate, none will fight
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives
This race departs, no one will survive
Heads to the feet, feet to the air
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair
End of all ends, body into dust
To greet death friends, extinction is a must

The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down
Every now and then he'll take a look around
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again
With trembling hands, he wipes a tear
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go
But spare a thought as you pass him by
Take a closer look and you'll say
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday
A lonely grave, and soon forgot
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear
For anyone who's passing near
It names the person lying here as you And you, and you, and you...

Beware of their coming
Take heed our time is near
Fatality relinquish not
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy
They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon
Their steeds were full charging, called destruction and doom
' Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night
And all in all it was a terrible sight
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
We gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get out of this place
There's a man with a needle who's pleading to get to my face
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can
It's all becoming too much,  I can't cope, for one man
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
Skyrider, supersonic flyer
Nightdriver, the demon of desire
Spinesnapper, you tried your best to break us
Throatchoker, you thought that you could take us
The fright of your life, the fright of your life
The fright of your life is here guaranteed
This is no illusion confessing confusion you're freed
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win
Oh, what a mess  I am blessed, dominations set in
Now we are taken unto the island of domination

Sinner rider, rides in with the storm
The  Devil rides beside him
The  Devil is his god,  God help you mourn
Do you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder?
Deafen every living thing about
Can you, can you see it, can you?
See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising, time is running out
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner!  Sinner!
( Is this obligation?)
Sinner!  Sinner!
His steed of fury
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the carcasses of war
But if it's hungry, then its very presence
Disrupts the calm into the storm
Curse and damn you all, you'll fall by the hand of the
Sinner!  Sinner!
( Desegregation)
Sinner!  Sinner!
God of the devils, god of the devils
Won't you help them pray?
God of the devils, god of the devils
Is there no other way?
Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight?
Can't you see their blood is boiling, setting them alight?
Thirty years now sleeping, so sound
War raises its head and looks slowly around
The sinner is near, sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin' around
Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain?
Can't you hear their blood is boiling, setting them alight?
Sinner,  Sinner,  Sinner,  Sinner!
Sinner!  Sinner!
Sinner!  Sinner!
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Curse and damn you all, you fall by the hand of the
Sinner

Throughout the soft and timeless days of  August
Till now the shadows begin to grow much longer
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
I give you this, the last rose of summer
A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
Till one day, not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose bud,  I shall return
A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
In your long shadows, the last rose of summer
In the sunset, the last rose of summer
Take this rose that  I give you
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
Don't worry about the winter, the last rose of summer
I shall return, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer...



I made a spike about nine o'clock on a  Saturday
All eyes hit me as  I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff,  New  York, fire island
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled " Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up,  I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that
I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours
Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess  I dream in pictures, not colours
The true free expression  I demand is human rights, right
I gave my life,  I am immortal
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming
Raw deal

Once  I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by,  I'm still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears
All alone, no one cares, so much to give to you all out there
Take me now, in your arms, let me rest, safe from harm
Oh,  I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me?
Here they come, here come the tears...

Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin
Exploding, reloading, this quest never-ending Until  I give out my last breath
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin

Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn Looking like a comet slicing through the morn Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches fries into a crisp Let him get close to you so you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smolder, blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter Here he comes now Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you see the light again
So much self-indulgence results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us with combustive dance
All shall bear the branding of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses melting into one
Only when there's order will his job be done
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Here he comes now
Bow to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?

You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why  I'm alive within
I can't find the words, my mind is dead
It's better by you, better than me
Guess you'll have to tell her how  I tried
To speak up thoughts  I've held so long inside
Tell her now  I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you, better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you, better than me You can tell what  I want it to be You can say what  I only can see It's better by you, better than me
Guess  I'll have to change my way of living
Don't want to really know the way  I feel
Guess  I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you, better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you, better than me You can say what  I only can see You can tell what  I want it to be It's better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can tell what  I want it to be ( Better than me)
You can say what  I only can see
Better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can say what  I only can see ( Better than me)
You can tell what  I want it, what  I want it, what  I want it to be

Wild-eyed and tight-fisted,  I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and  Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep
To infest and decay from the core
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Stained class king

I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow
I saw a searing flash of light erupt and skyward go
I staggered back in dazed surprise
What was it  I had seen?
And as  I stood there mesmerized  I heard my spirit scream
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back
The call is out throughout the world
United we must stand
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
When they come to take control every man must play his role
They won't take our world away when the children we leave
Will have to believe in today
We warn you now you things out there
Whatever you may send
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh

They laughed at their gods
And fought them in vain
So he turned his back on them
And left them in pain
Now here come the saints
With their banners held high
Each one of them martyrs
Quite willing to die
Wake the dead, the saints are in  Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
Cover your fists
Razor your spears
It's been our possession
For 8,000 years
Fetch the scream eagles
Unleash the wild cats
Set loose the king cobras
And blood sucking bats
Wake the dead, the saints are in  Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
We are saints
In  Hell
We are saints
In  Hell
We're going down
Into the fire
We're going down
Into the fire
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
As carnage took toll for the bell
Abattoir, abattoir, mon  Dieu quelle horreur
For a time is was like second  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
The battle is over
The saints are alive
How can we all thank you
We felt so despised
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell...

Who gives you the right to come here and tell me
I have to leave this place my home
To you it's a jungle, to me it's a kingdom
Where (my) people are free there to roam
Born with the stars we are happy and peaceful
Until now we were left undisturbed
But you rupture the forests our gardens
And fill them with filth from your cities unheard
Savage, who is savage Leave your morals, stake your claim Savage, you are savage Modern man can take the blame
You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man
Savage, who is savage Leave your morals, stake your claim Savage, you are savage Modern man can take the blame
You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man
Savage, savage
Savage, savage
Who's the savage
Modern man
Who's the savage
Modern man

He had enough, he couldn't take anymore He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride The wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah!  I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But  I shall win
How many like him are there still?
But to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost?
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin It's not fit for living in
Beyond the realms of death

I heard a human voice who sang like no one else I heard a proud lady singing loud Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn But soon she found she was underground and wasted I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage Her body shook oh, she did her stuff She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much If you take the smooth you got to take the rough
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd I felt the sound shower around And he would take you with him where no music's been before As you merged the power surge together His music knew no limits if you were in its wake You had no choice, no, but hear its voice And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream But once so strong survive or become weak
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame But fast car users lose That legend's born from death and that is such a shame Because every year new ones appear
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid

Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my body's aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton,  Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Ooh, delivering the goods
Shake down, rock them boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good
We're going to load you with our brand
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
Have it your way
Stealing your hearts
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Going to do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You got to learn your lesson
Because there ain't nobody here to defend your heart
Faster, higher, until it seems that we're going to break
Ohh, shooting further, giving more than you're ever going to take
Leaving your heads, crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods

When the day is over
I like to ease my mind
By juicing up my system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I smack a bottle open
I crank the  Hi- Fi high
I'm in a seventh heaven
Ooh,  I can touch the sky
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about my rock forever
It starts to moving to me
Just that  I can't explain
It's like a brilliant sunshine
After standing in the pouring rain
My skin begins to tingle
Ooh, right on down my back
It's really got me fevered
Pounding my senses flat
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about my rock forever
Rock, rock, rock forever
I love my
Rock, rock, rock forever
My fever
Rock, rock, rock forever
Always going to
Rock, rock, rock forever
I can't stop talking about rock
Now give them back, boys
So when you get those blue days
Here's just what to do
Switch into this lifeline
And feel it rushing through
Before you know it, blue days
Are better left behind
By juicing up your system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about the
Rock forever, rock forever
I'm going to rock forever

I traveled to a distant shore
I felt  I had to go
An inner voice had called me there
But why  I did not know
I saw the evening star rise up
Shining out to sea
And now  I understand at last what it means
What it all means
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
I used to tempt fate
I couldn't see straight
I faltered through my younger days
Never knowing where  I was going
Then something helped me penetrate the haze
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Now  I am stronger
The haze no longer
Will veil my future destiny
Such inspirations and new sensations
Though nothing strange has changed in me
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
I'm home once more, much better for
The things that  I have found
Much wiser now, so simple how
Each time  I turn around
I see the evening star rise up
Shining out on me
And now  I understand at last what it means
What it all means
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels!  A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams!  From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools!  Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams!  Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Got to leave your seat, got to get up upon your feet
Going to move you to the rhythm until you never can stop
We got the power, we got the music, and you bet you that we can use it
Going to take it rock-bottom, going to take it to the top
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Move a little nearer, you know you got to follow your leaders
Because we need you, like you need us for sure
We're going to drive you, we're going to ride you, we're going to get right inside you
And if you want to keep going, just shout out for more
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Sing your song, we'll listen to you
Sing your song, the spotlights on you
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So  I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So  I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking
We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up
You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
But  I'll make out easy because  I see straight through you
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
Because you'll get hungry in the heat of the night
And then we'll make love, just when it's right
And when we make love tonight
We'll be burning up
I know you feel the same
I know you feel the flame
Staring deep inside of you
Burning you up, breaking you down
Breaking you out in a cold sweat
And as you lose control, of your very soul
Your desire takes over
You'll feel the heat sway
You're round to my way
And suddenly you'll know that you're burning up
You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So  I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So  I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking
We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up
We're burning up

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around Making me do things  I don't want to do
I can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things  I don't want to see
' Cause you're the  Green  Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night, dragging us up or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, then slip away, leaving me here
Trying to keep from following you

I never give true answers,  I never tell no lies I never walk a straight line, so never get surprised I don't ask no favors, so don't get abused
I learned to win when  I was young So  I'm never ever going to lose
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I never ask no questions,  I never speak my mind I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive I take care of business, it takes care of me
I look after myself and do it well Because somebody's always looking for me
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
What manner of man am  I?
A gun, lump sum and then  I move on
What manner of man are you?
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue
I do what  I do because  I can't do nothing better
You do what you do, just defending yourself Because you got nothing better to do
I got no face, no name,  I'm just a killing machine
I cut the population down, if you know what  I mean
I never stop in one place,  I move about the cities
Got expensive tastes, but  I hasten to add that I'm the best that there is
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you

I move as fast as  I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a madman
My feet don't touch the ground
I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming
They know  I'm running wild
Dead or alive there's nothing
That bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall
They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and  I defy
Because what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild
No chains can hold me down
I always breakaway
I never hear society
Tell me what to do or say
I taste the life that pleases me
And raise a storm for all the world to see
I never stumble, never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but  I walk tall
And  I demand respect
I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming
They know  I'm running wild
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
Get out of my way
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
You better believe it
Wild...

Before the dawn,  I hear you whisper In your sleep " Don't let the morning take him" Outside the birds begin to call As if to summon up my leaving
It's been a lifetime since  I found someone Since  I found someone who would stay I've waited too long, and now you're leaving Oh, please don't take it all away
It's been a lifetime since  I found someone Since  I found someone who would stay I've waited too long, and now you're leaving Oh, please don't take it all away
Before the dawn,  I hear you whisper
In your sleep " Don't let the morning take him"

We turn and face each other
My fingers pull your hair
You wince and jerk my wrist off
I bite my lip and stare
Your stance at once defiant
I'm rigid to your pose
You clench your teeth in anger
My loving swells and grows
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
You're dragged into my vision
Trapped serving to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout  I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion by
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
Going to take you
Want to get through
Going to make you
Do what  I want
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
You're dragged into my vision
Trapped serving to my needs
Maybe your imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
Come on evil, yeah
You give me evil evil fantasies
Come on you evil and
Give me give me give me fantasies
I want to look at it those evil fantasies
If you need it  I want to give it
Give me, give me, give me fantasies
Come on and get it evil fantasies

There  I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as  I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if  I live or die
So  I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future,  I can't even start I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now, grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding, corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Cleaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off  I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal  Gods Metal  Gods
Metal  Gods Metal  Gods
Machines are taking all over With mankind in their command In time they'd like to discover How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why  I won't get caught
Refuse to bait the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
I've held my licence
It came with birth
For self-reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill,  I take my leave
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United...

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one  A. M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when  I make my moves right
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing,  I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when  I begin
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what  I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight,  I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time  I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance,  I'm going to take
Gonna kick out trouble and strife
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
No,  I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going  I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties, no compromise
Want to taste what it's like to be free
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
Alright,  I'll gather my things, go through the door
Live and let live from now on
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned
I got a will of my own
I go as  I please, fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When  I need it, then  I'll ask for advice
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise

From a fireball we came
Crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all
To make our own
Let us be left alone
Lay the tasks and pay the price
Everything suffice
Crushed and bolted all we craved
After every whim
What a state we're in
Is pain better than the grave?
Well, when we talk with other men
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger
In the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpetbaggers bluff and strike
Kiss of  Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Well,  I've said it before, and  I'll say it again
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel
It's easy to go along with the crowd
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
Oh, that's the way to find what you've been missing
So,  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
A chance before  I fall
You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice, it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your bidding
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go
If you get it wrong, at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together
And  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm going to do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
A chance before  I fall
On the highway, on the highway
Making a curve or taking the strain
On the decline, or out 
on the wane
Oh, everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend
Back on your feet to take the next bend
You'll weather every storm that's coming at you
And  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm going to do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
Yes,  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I got nothing to lose at all

Come on, come on now what you say
Somebody say you leave today
What's this thing you're doing to me
What's this fool you're trying to be
You're talking nothing but a load of guff
You're trying to put something in my lap, lap
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
I do,  I do anything for you
You make my stormy clouds blue
Inside out,  I'm upside down
Back to front,  I'm all around
Don't you leave me by myself
I don't like it
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away

I've done my share of working out
I want to go someplace where  I can scream and shout
Show me the lights, where  I can find
The only thing  I need to give me peace of mind
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
Where is the spark that kicks the air?
Where is the energy that charges everywhere?
I see the crowd,  I hear the roar
I feel my body start to leave the ground and soar
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
I'm going out in search of the bright lights
Somehow  I feel that tonight is the right night
I'm almost there  I've got the vibration
It's coming strong from this generation
My blood is hot, from now on  I'm set free
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me
Because this is it and  I'm hot rockin'
Don't let it stop, don't let it end
Please let it carry on and on and on again
I get so high knocked off my feet, yeah
This is the only way  I want,  I want,  I want,  I want
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
It's all  I want
It's all  I crave
I just want to go
Hot rockin'!

Change, change, it's all rearranging
Looking around at the, the situation
Go back, see what you're doing
The way you're taking life you're going to rack and ruin
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
Slow down, see where we're getting
The way things are going now
Your life, it ain't pleasing
Had my share of up and down
Don't spend time, don't spend time rushing around
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
To say
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( Turning circles)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( So stay away)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( Oh,  I got something more to say)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh

Full moon is rising The sky is black I heed your call  I'm coming back
The road is straight cast Wind's in my eyes The engine roars between my thighs
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but  I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love

Golden halos radiating higher
Diamond visions softly breathing fire
Sky processions we are watching you arrive
Silver crystals arching beams below
White light spirals lifting up to go
Glass formations solar angels spread their wings
Spectral gliders drifting in the air
Wheels of wonder floating everywhere
Draped in rainbows gently we ascend

Say you want to rip it up
Paint the town red
Want to do the hot spots
Get it in the head
You drive me crazy
I know your game
You done it all before
You'll do it all again
You say yes,  I say no
My blood's on fire
I grit my teeth
You're nothing but a teaser
Give me some relief
I'm looking at the bottle
Sinking to the floor
I got to white knuckles
Can't take it anymore
What do you treat me so
What  I do,  I do for you

Alright baby
You know how to have a good time don't you?
It's the way you stand
You're always attracting attention
Now with your hands on your hips, and a
Snarl on your lips
Your eyes wore the look of danger
There's a lion in your heart
That's set to quick start
To a glance from any stranger
You give as good as you get
No one's beat you yet
You take the lead
You never need
You know all the moves you've got to make
You take it all, you take it all the way
You never do things by half
You're a man with a reputation
You never shy when the problems fly
You can cope with any situation
You take the wheel and crack the whip
You never slip
You rule the roost
You always boast
Yeah you're looking after number one

You've got it,  I want it
My little  Troubleshooter
I need it, you feed it
My hunger drives me to you
You bring me around with your velvet hands
You're getting new life to me
You put me back into promised land
Just where you know  I should be
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You're giving,  I'm getting
I'm getting satisfaction
You're making,  I'm taking
I want some heavy action
You're bending, but  I'm mending
Getting back together
You really got got got what it takes
To make a bad man better
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
Right down, right down, right down....
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You've got it,  I want it
My little  Troubleshooter
I need it, and you'll feed it
My hunger drives me to you
You're bending and  I'm a-mending
Getting back together
You really got got got what it takes
To make a bad man better
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down...

I'm rolling and riding away
Because  I'm a reeling and feeling okay
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on the run
I'm a rocking and selling my soul
Because  I'm living for rock and for roll
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on, yes,  I'm on the run
I'm shaking all day and all night
Yeah  I'm doing what  I know is right
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on, yes,  I'm on the run
' Cause  I'm on the run
Yes,  I'm on the run
On the run


Up here in space,  I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, 
think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape,  I’m watching all the time
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
Always in focus, 
you can’t feel my stare I zoom into you, but you don’t know  I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
I'm elected electric spy
I'm elected, protected, detective, electric eye

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowing  God of  Mars
Body burning bright
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screaming, demons yell
Bursting through the clouds
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind

I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me out of my mind
I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing its sense of all kind
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game that's being played
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals have been made
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone ( I can't take it)
Bloodstone ( You got me living on a)
Bloodstone ( I don't want that)
Bloodstone

I move away, it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like  I thought it would
Help me, begging you please You got the power, down on my knees Give me some kind of life Leave me be
Take these chains off Take them off from my heart Take these chains off Take them off from my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave I tried to run but  I'm tied to you like a slave
It's my fault loving you so You were so precious, how could  I know? You turned mean overnight Poor, poor me
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
I don't owe you anything Why don't you get out of my life?
Through it all the memories cling
And  I can't sleep at night
Help me,  I'm begging you please
You got the power, down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart

I want to tell you, hey  I think you ought to know
The way you're treating me,  I feel  I'll have to go
I've heard the rumors and it seems they're coming true
You do what suits you, but then that's nothing new
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How  I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that  I've cried
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messing round, practice what you preach
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way  I see it, oh, we're dead or we're alive
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How  I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that  I've cried
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind Fill your brain with orders and that's not right They're playing out a game that draws you closer Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear Always taking, baby, but that's okay What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me Told you once, you're never gonna win the race Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then  I tell you  I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Screaming, screaming vengeance
Screaming, vengeance, screaming


I'd spend my days alone,  I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there
Like  I was in a cell, a captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control
Down on the streets below, bright city lights would glow
The energy would rise
And through the heat,  I'd gaze, still counting empty days
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can  I break this spell?
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
Then one night as  I walked,  I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance, our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar
Oh, how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
So destiny has bought us oh, so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream, at last,  I'll be with you forever
And all at once, it feels so right
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
Fever, oh you set my soul on fire
Fever, filled me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night

Hypnotize me, mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip
Light my fire with cold desire
Losing all my grip
Eat my diamonds ( Eat my diamonds)
Drinking all my gin
Feast your eyes on ( Feast your eyes on)
A whole lot of sin
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
Took my dreams and now it's seems
You're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all  I had
Build my funeral pyre
Stop pretending ( Stop pretending)
Got me growing old
Your torment is ( Your torment is)
Fit to snap my soul
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
You took my heart and left it blown to smithereens
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh and drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed
Going under, hear the thunder
Death defying grace
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face
Vicious talking ( Vicious talking)
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised ( So abused)
I'm a human sacrifice
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe...
I can't stand it anymore

Fast and furious, we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate, whoever would contend its right
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane we're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare

Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
You gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth

So defiant
But they'll never put us down
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Tough as steel, stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer, yeah
Grab the lead in the race

Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
No denying

Because it's so defiant
Everybody scream it again!

Along deserted avenues, steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready, prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys, smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell, a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars, the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives
Now facing one another, the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel

When you feel safe, when you feel warm
That's when  I rise, that's when  I crawl
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room, where in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you  I creep
Then  I descend close to your lips
Across you  I bend, you smile as  I sip
Now you are mine, in my control
One taste of your life and  I own your soul
Softly you stir, gently you moan
Lust's in the air, wake as  I groan
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Invites you, invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you, delights you
It drains you to white
Love bites
You knew at first sight you'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite there'd be no turning back
So come in my arms,  I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites

Wrapped tight around me like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body as the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable, let rip
And eat me alive
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal, panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone and gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
I'm going to force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Eat me alive
Bound to deliver
 as 
you give and  I collect
Squealing impassioned as the 
rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum, spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Alive, alive, alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat

You can look to the left or look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes, he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights, flashing colors
Sleepless nights
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
They'll slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day, burning hell fire
You're blown away
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
No, no
No, no
No, no
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)

In the last rays of the setting sun and the past days
Yeah, that's where our memories run
And all of those times still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and  I'll wait until summer, you never understood
That  I'll wait forever for love that's only good
As the light starts to dim, the fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Oh, no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh, no, say, it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh, can't you see my heart is broken in two?
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And  I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
When the night comes down
And  I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

I know you like it hot
I'd love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty,  I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside you
Until the power splits your head
We're going to rock you
Until your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with the iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
So come on, let's tell the world

We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith

Now let's see what you're made of
He is coming, you can't run
Violators that get caught
Will wish that they'd never been born
Exterminator
You are dead
Mutilate
Sharpened razor
Takes your head
Jugulator
Predit hater
You are trapped
Decimate
Desecrator
Your neck snapped
Jugulator
Jugulator, he is near
Attracted by the stench of fear
Part demonic, part machine
Hungry and it's time to feed
Iron claws, fangs of steel
Dripping from his tasty meal
Now it's time to jugulate
Feel your skull disintegrate
Jugulator, killing time now
Reaches in and rips your spine out
Violator
Big mistake
Mutilate
Vindicator
Rib cage break
Flesh and bones
Are massacred
Jugulator
Desecrator
Jugulator

Atrocities made every day
Religiously
Their sins, they hide
Can never disguise
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
They wage their wars
Such profiteers will nail us all
Their crimes concealed
Despicably reveal
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained lies
They fire at will, intent to kill
They have no conscience
They have no conscience
Ethnic cleansing, nothing more
Blood of nations, blood of war
Turn blind eyes from all your crimes
You bare our souls, show no remorse
You cannot wash the blood stains off
They turn their backs
While others commit grisly acts
We're scarred for life
By politicians' greedy
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained crimes
Blood stained lands
Blood stained minds
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
And while such predators
Stalk this earth
Disguised as saints, they kill our faith
Obsessed by greed
Lying through their teeth
They cannot wash the blood stains off

The hangman's noose won't get me
Gas chambers never stress me
They can line me up against the wall
No firing squad will make me
Confess or even break me
I'll stand alone or not at all
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will surrender
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
No shackles made will chain me
No endless pain will change me
The scars will testify this all
No solitary confinement
Will break my strong resignment
I'll die before  I will conform
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will surrender
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
Read in my obituary
Defiance breeds victory
No cage they make can hold me
No law enforced controls me
No trap that's sprung stops me for long
No prison cell contains me
No snare they set will claim me
Relentlessly  I'll fight them all
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will be driven asunder
No surrender
We never will raise the white flag
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
Indoctrination
Will never suppress me
They're seriously mistaken
' Cause  I'll take them down with me
And just before they're finished
They'll scream along with me
We are all dead meat

Dead man walking
We've all been detained
For the crimes we've committed
They stayed execution
But we'll never get acquitted
Waiting for the day when they strap us in
When they pull the lever
Hear the goddamn screams
Shake with fear
Electric chair
We're all inside
Homicide related
They'll show no mercy
And we don't anticipate it
Move a little closer
Every day to meet our maker
They cover up our face
And then they close the circuit breaker
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh come on man
Give me a break
I made one mistake, that's all it takes
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh no, they're taking me slow
One way ticket to
Death row
So what's the matter, son
Too young to die
Take it like a man
Don't cry
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Say a prayer, best beware
It's not very nice
In the electric chair
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh no, they're taking me slow
One way ticket to
Death row

Your head, you will lose it
Severed when executed
You always thought
You'd never get caught
Decapitate
Sealing your fate
Rebels' futile efforts
Are quelled with effective measures
The sentence is read
Words that you dread
Decapitate
Walk through  Hell's gate
You've lost your head sir Well, you will tomorrow Sleep well
This court's best deterrent
To set new precedents
The verdict of course
Couldn't be worse
Decapitate
Example be made
Decapitate
Will seal your fate

Speak to me
Of those days  I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else  I can do
But one thing's certain
I'm coming back for you
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
It's time to burn in hell
Say my name
I can hear you whisper
Not to blame
You are going to blister
Scream in the night
I've been counting the days
And it's so amusing
To see you again
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Die, why?  Time to pay the price
Kill,  I will have my sacrifice
Plead with fear,  I am getting near
Friend, liar, time to eat some fire
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're going to love me
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Burn in hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in hell, burn

Turn me off, pull the plug
Leave me with some dignity
I am not what  I was
And  I don't need the sympathy
Alive inside me
No one can hear me
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
Paralyzed in my shell
Enduring every endless day
Immobilized on my back
Aware of everything they say
Extricate me
Eliminate me
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
I can't blink my eye
Or cry or even speak
They crowd around my bed
Condescending words are said
Thinking  I don't hear or know
What is going on, hello
Can't you suckers hear my cries?
From inside  I'm still alive
It's my decision to abort
Turn off the goddamn life support
Let me pass from this world
Slowly fade away in peace
Comprehending
Unrelenting
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot

Abductors, they come at night
They come at night and they infiltrate you
They paralyze and they mentally rape you
Expressionless, they disintegrate you
The probe your soul and desecrate you
Abductors will bleed your mind
Abductors, cutting inside
They come for you in the night
They strap you as someone's slain before you
And powerless begin to explore you
You scream in pain but they just ignore you
The bring machines and they drill and bore you
Abductors, cutting inside
Abductors, drinking your mind
No one believes that you
Were chosen from few
Defiled and abused
By alien rituals
You wake in fright they are in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment
Abductors, will bleed your mind
Abductors, cutting inside
They come for you in the night
You wake in fright they are in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment
They send you back and disorientate you
A lesser race they discriminate you
Whatever said will incriminate you
No one believes
The skeptics laugh and annihilate you
They dig you out and excavate you
Authority and even  God forsakes you
No one believes
Hey, maybe  I am just a liar

Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the nights before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding cannot stand the strain
Standing on trial, scrutinize me
Questionize my strong denial
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Windows, illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Free fall as  I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Changing my course blurred and scorched
Breathing exhausts we distort
By gravity of such  G-force
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Free fall never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within
Wanting much more implore you
Near to death's door to ignore
The screams of all
Who fall before
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet

They have blown away the daylight hours we had
Left a legacy, a deadly aftermath
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands
As we spiral down into oblivion
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight
We shall never see another setting sun
Time to rise up and ascend, the end has come
No more willpower, choked by hellfire
Darkness above blackening out the sun
Gripped by steel claws Corrosion eating us
So before we're all devoured
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From up amongst the clouds
In cathedral spires
Jaws of corruption swallow us as one
Consuming every nation
Evoke resistance getting none
Complete disintegration, no good to defend
There can be but one outcome
We are no more ascend
Oh, we're so tired
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From up amongst the clouds
In cathedral, in cathedral spires

White bolts of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm
War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm
Forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain forever undying
Judas is rising
Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world ( Dark prince of the world)
Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved
The burden of shame
Echos the prophecy
Ascending from  Hell
Forever despising
Judas is rising
Apprentice revealed
Deceivers are crying
My crucified steel
Evangelizing
Judas is rising
Judas is rising

Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit
Down to holy  Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die
We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel
Rolling down the m-way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there
Until we all went broke
When we don the leather And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow Into one voice Took on all the world It had no choice
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel
We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind To be with our own kind
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel

If you think it's over Better think again There'll be no compromise
Time to hit the power Feel adrenaline Move into overdrive
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
If you think  I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Take it to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the revolution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution, yeah!
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution ( Get ready for the revolution)
Time for retribution ( Retribution)
Here comes the revolution ( Something's in the air)
Time for retribution ( Time to change, it's time to change)
( It's time to change, it's time to change)
Here comes the revolution ( It's time to change)
Time for retribution
( You better watch out tonight)
Here comes the revolution
( You better watch out tonight)
Time for retribution ( You better watch out tonight)
( You better watch out for the revolution)
( You better watch out for the revolution)
( Bring it down, bring it down)
( Bring it down, bring it down)

You said  I could never find a way to ease your mind
But where  I go you wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot
So  I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Desert heat can wear you down
But still  I'm rolling through
Did  I see your figure in the haze?
I am driven by your thirst
To quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price  I pay
So  I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
I'm beckoned by the glow
Of kerosene and tumbleweed
They're calling out, forevermore
Worth fighting for
I'm leading in the wind
Head bowed down from what  I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for
So  I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Worth fighting for

Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth
Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring
Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regaled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again
The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out!
Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's  Gideon's quest
To take  Satan's throne
The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverize all in its' wake
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demons out!

Born on the other side
Of the track
Got to get out of here
I won't look back
Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive
Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire, let them roll
Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
Can tie me down
Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire
Forever
Wheels
Wheels of fire...

Angel, put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again
Oh angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began
And  I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free
Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun
When  I close my eyes,  I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
Angel shine your light on me
Angel we'll meet once more,  I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh, angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again

Here they come
These  Gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed
Speed of death
Cross fired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares
Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
All incensed
To overthrow
Strong defense
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fate's renowned
Put to rest
Abominations grow
Time to ram it down
Judgment for the tyrant
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and pain infernal
Honor bound your strength repleted
To no end they're undefeated
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You brought them through their despair
Hellrider,  Hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished
Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
Their valiants never yield
Triumph to the  Gods
Vanquished of enslavers
Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider!

And so now it comes to pass
By the eventide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class
For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the sentinel
So, it goes forevermore
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor

Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof
A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
Its leathered hide glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar
This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me
Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl
This highlands layer of mystery
Retains a lost worlds empathy
Resilient to discovery
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me
( This legend lives through centuries

This creature's peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace
On and on and on

With weapons drawn we claim the future
Invincible through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk till dawn
Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our union thrives, so go to  Hell
Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize
Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser red lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace
We fight with firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise

I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike!

The devil's moved from  Georgia His mission's still the same
The world's become his oyster once again
If you don't think you're worthy
And you don't meet the cause
He knows what's going on behind closed doors
Beware there's voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
A master of deception
Who takes you by the hand
Then leads you to the palace of the damned
He pulls the strings inside you
And plays upon your fears
Your final scream is music to his ears
Beware there's voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
I'm caught up in this voodoo
Trying to break free
I feel  I'm being smothered
Trapped by this entity
Blackened clouds surround me
Filling me with dread
I can't escape the horror
With the devil in my head
He relishes the suffering
Can't stand this heart attack
My life's been taken hostage
And it's never coming back
Beware there's voodoo in the night
The devil's got you in his sight
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies

Like a cobra, they will strike
And like lions caged we'll fight
We were taken not by choice
They put anger in our voice
We were fearless but so afraid
Though in our hearts we still felt pain
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
Like a demon leads the youth
We are terrible in truth
No time to falter, no turning back
When we come under attack
There is no question as with a friend
We have our honour to defend
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
At war
We are together till the end
We have our honour to defend
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed
Never the heroes ( We were never the heroes)
We were made to fight ( We were made to fight)
Never the heroes, we were sacrificed at war

Born out of hell from the depths of  Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls
Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed, sorceries abound
Necromancer Death's his guiding light Necromancer Stealing afterlife
Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast
Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns
Portents of dread thrives on remains
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Raising the dead, cadaver consumed
Sacraments said, bodies exhumed
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing after life
Stealing after life
Death's his guiding light

Sun sets on the nations
World's in her disguise
Pray for all that matters
Saviour in my eyes
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Eden has been wasted
Deadly poison fills the air
Kneel down in forgiveness
While there's still time, if you care
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
I couldn't dream
To be without her kind
They wouldn't let her be
Or heal what she defiled
You are the hate that beats mankind
Torturous lies that lead the blind
Squandered the truth from all we said
You are the reason  I feel dead
Mountains start to crumble
Tumble in the sea
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one


Drawn from years of self denying
Lost in chaos before the storm
Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle
We can settle our old scores ( Our old scores)
Look to the stars and challenge all of  Heaven
Resist the  Devil, dare to dream
By grace of  God within our hearts eternal
For our salvation is for everyone
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
We'll face our foes so they can hear our voices
The land rejoices in empathy
This trial by fire will build from their attrition
It's ammunition for our enemies
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
Send in the valiant, fight for what you believe
Then we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We bring the lights
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins

Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's nothing left for you to prove
You get a chance then now's the time to move
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower
No remedy so be afraid
It's cutting deep just like the razor blade
No escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Rays of redemption
Fall from the sky
Into the maelstrom
Blink of an eye
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower
Immolate the bodies
No one will be saved
Consecrate with fire
Ashes fill the grave
Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's no escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower

In a league of his own
A villain with no morals
Above the law and reckless
Mutating day by day
Invisible and silence
Conspiring to get power
This man will stop at nothing
To always get his way
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
When you're mind in a vice
He twists and turns with terror
Keeps building up the pressure
Until you're feeling numb
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
The spectre creeps behind you
Shrouded by his stealth
Ignore him at your peril
He kills to heal himself
In the blink of an eye
He marks you with precision
Corrupting all he touches
Salvation in your soul
Scourging you in silence
As he makes his incision
The venom's taking over
This tyrant takes his toll
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
You'll be frozen in fright
Like the glint of his knife
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre

The river shows no mercy
The tower looms into my view
I sense my execution's closing
With darkness all around me
The axe is ground to end my days
The raven's cry proclaims repentance
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Into the storm
I'm gonna win
Killer of sin
Saved by the traitors gate
A man betrayed for treason
I only wanted what was right
To bring a purpose by rebellion
The storm is soon arriving
And rain will wash away my blood
This walk of death will bring survival
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Ready to die
Carry the day
Bury the lie
Tear down the traitors gate
Forgive me for my sins
I meant no harm to you
So let the axe man fall
To justify what  I begin
Where will you be tomorrow
Now they've removed this mortal coil
I hope and pray  I bring you freedom
For 
Honour,
  God and country
This world can be a better place
As  I ascend from my conviction
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
River of blood
Turning the tide
Cause of the flood
Destroying the traitors gate
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Losing my head
Blunt  of the axe
Alive when  I'm dead
Escape from the traitors gate

You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack  I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause there's no surrender
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
You know the way that  I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who  I am,  I'm just a non-stop fighter
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
I'm chasing a dream as  I go higher
You know  I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

Hey,  I am the voice of your anger
Hey,  I am the voice of your pain
Hey,  I crave the feeling of danger
Hey,  I am the one with no name
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
They don't know the way that  I'm feeling
They don't know the depth of my rage
I am like the wolf that is prowling
Hey,  I won't be found in a cage
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Lone wolf is there to guide me
From death to life again

Now look and listen as you walk around
And you'll hear voices on the wind
Those lonely whispers from this hallowed ground
Just take your time as they begin
As the sun goes down
The silence is profound
For they gave so much
So we might go on and live
Laying peaceful they forgive
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
In fields of wonder where those swallows soar
Our hearts are weary as we pray
The grass is greener from the tears that fall
For you on this remembrance day
Your message has been heard
Words of wisdom have been shared
Their despair won't matter as they rise above
There is no end to love
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red
From this earth take wing
Shine down from the sky
We see you as you fly
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red
On the sea of red
Where the glory has no end
There's a place for us
As our lives begin again
Bow your head
Sea of red
