Tonight the circle is meeting again Who will be the first to fall in trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain Tonight a spirit we will glance
So as they're approaching ghostly hour Seven people here are joining hands
They think they know the spirit to appear Contact, the table starts to dance
Time is standing still It's a dangerous meeting
They're gonna get themselves killed
Tonight, the circle is broken forever Seven people dead within a trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight, seven souls are reaching hell
Time was standing still The meeting is over
Their journey is on
Oh, they should have known Not to play with the powers of hell
Some people have lost their way
Some people have lost their mind
Am  I awake or is this just a dream?
I had a nightmare, some sort of vision
I was stuck in an empty room
When the black book appeared
The lights were dim, but the face in the
Book was in daylight
Eyes of fire staring at me
It's the eyes of a woman
And  I see, on her spirit
Steppin' out of the  Book
I hear her callin' for her coven to come
There's a light in the doorway
Entering shadows whose number is 13
They do the sign of the  Devil's seed
I'm in the middle of a magic ring
Somebody tell me, what's goin' on
" Only we know the secret of the curse
That you bear"
Listen, they sing, the coven sings
Night after night  I hear them sing
No, they're still here,  I can hear them
Again
Night after  Night  I have this dream
( You are insane!)
" You're only living on borrowed time from your fate"
Stay away white magician, young lovers
And mourning wife
You're not welcome on our land
So  I speak for the dead
Magic circles drawn after midnight
Around graves to be opened
He'll use the wand to raise a body
He'll ask the questions and he'll burn the remains
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
Copulation in the night
Two shadows upon a grave
Screams of pleasure and screams of pain
Young lovers, you must be insane
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So  I say again: stay away, it's desecration of souls
Dyin' flowers upon the grave
Of a husband who's lost his maid
She's there on duty, and the tears she cries
They don't belong where the flowers lie
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So  I say again: stay away, it's desecration of souls
I forbid you entrance here
You step on hallowed ground
Don't you see this chapel
Shut up, hold your tongue
They must rest in silence
It's the rebirth of the unborn
Tonight is the night
The spirits of the unborn will play tonight
The unborn will play tonight
They will dance around the chapel
It's a feast for the dead
They will make a fool of the priest
And the dead boy's choir will sing
A song for the dead
To whom life has just begun
Life of the unborn
This one's for the unborn
Did you know? 13 days have come and gone Since we had the first of  June
The spirits of the unborn will play tonight
Forgive them, they didn't die
By the symbol of the creator,  I swear henceforth to be A faithful servant of his most puissant arch-angel The prince  Lucifer, whom the creator designated as his regent And  Lord of this world,  Amen
I deny  Jesus  Christ, the deceiver And  I abjure the  Christian faith Holding in contempt all of it's works As a being now possessed of a human body In this world  I swear to give my full allegiance To it's lawful master to worship him Our  Lord oh,  Satan and no other In the name of  Satan, the ruler of earth Open wide the gates of hell and come forth from the abyss By these names, oh,  Satan,  Leviathan Belial,  Lucifer,  I will kiss the goat I swear to, to give my mind My body and soul unreservedly To the furtherance of our  Lord Our  Lord  Satan, where  Satan's designs
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be A world without end,  Amen
Ahhh...
This magic winter night  I see a light
Again  I hear that tune, some sort of croon
Oh no, no, no!  Oh, my brain
Oh whoa, oh
Ahhh...
I see them gypsy wagons left in the snow
Oh  I must see that lady,  I have to know
Gypsy woman, let me inside
Ahhh...
They say you know the secret, secret of time
So gaze into your crystal and tell me all you see
Gypsy woman, let me know
" Oh, my son, you were never gone
You are the  Devil's child and so am  I"
Gypsy now  I know you're not my mother
You're a part of my soul
It's clear for all to see
Oh no, no, no,  I am you
Gypsy you're inside of me
I turn off the lights, we like darkness
Now you call my name, you finally came
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
Now  I see you clear, we raise our glasses
Welcome to my house, princes of  Hell
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
I will bring in here my crystal ball
I will gaze, you will know what is to come
I'm amazed of what  I've seen tonight
I won't tell a living soul, they would not believe
Welcome princess of  Hell
Never will  I break the oath  I gave
I hail you again in  Satan's  Name, princes of  Hell
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
We will be back, we will be back

If you say  Heaven,  I say a  Castle of  Lies
You say forgive him,  I say  Revenge
My sweet  Satan,  You are  The  One
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave, by the dead
I was made a mercenary
In the legions of  Hell
Now  I'm king of pain,  I'm insane
You know, my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love, to hear you cry
I'd love, to feel you die
And  I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And  I'll be the last, to leave
I'd love, to hear you cry
And when you're down, beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
' Cause  I will eat your mind
Away out in  Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Well, don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
Now if you're breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're starting up a curse
Bringing evil disease
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
And the curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Making it all shady
So don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me
And meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become  Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross
And go to the middle of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become  Lucifer's child
Now crush it
Crush the cross!
Suck the blood
From this unholy knife
Say after me:
My soul belongs to  Satan
Now, now you're into my coven
You are  Lucifer's child
Into the coven
Lucifer's child
Halloween is the night
The legend says the ghost will rise
On  Halloween they can't redeem
A restless soul from an ancient scene
At the sound of the demon bell
Yes, everything will turn to  Hell
Rise, rise, rise
It's  Halloween
Rise, rise
The ghost will rise
Reconciled with the powers of darkness
He'll uncover a saint
You won't believe
Better see for yourself
I hear a bell
A sound from  Hell, the demon bell
I see a lighting shadow in between the graves
Swinging his sword of hate towards the gates of  Heaven
" Beelzebub,  Astaroth
Bring me the  Devil"
And as he says these words  I can't believe my eyes
Upon a burning cross
The  Lord  Jesus,  Satan's above
It must be a shame
To see the  Lord falling again
Now rise, reconcile with the powers of darkness
Uncover a saint
You better believe or see for yourself
Bring the black box to the altar
Now raise your hands and do the sign
All hail  Satan, yes hail  Satan
Lay down your swords, the evil star
It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven
Open the black box on the altar
Her blood is still hot, so let it out
All hail  Satan, yes hail  Satan
Now drink it, now drink, drink, forget that whore
It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven
I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross
 upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life
Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light
She was a witch Why did they take you away?
Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light
I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of  Hell
Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?
Nothing is left outside at the stake
They've taken her away from me
( I think  Melissa's still with us)
Come and join
My black masses
Bring along
Your iron axes
Now draw a circle
Right here in the light
I'll tell you
Just what to write
Elohim...  Adonai...  Tetragrammaton
Slaughtering babies
In ceremonial ways
If we're lucky
We can see them for days
' Cause baby blood
Is full of strength
But  I tell you
Oh how it stinks
Give me some baby blood
Black masses, black masses, black masses...
Running wild
Spittin' blood
In my lady's face
I show her my pets
A few rotten heads
And about my lady
If she can't take it
She's got to face it
I'll slaughter her too
Killing babies
Black masses
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh

Who are one and all things

Without beginning, without end
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Osiris,  Anubis
The underworld is yours
Osiris,  Anubis

O  Thou,  God of the dead
Lead my soul to the  Judgment  Hall
O  Thou,  Jackal  Head

Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Ammit, eater of the dead
Is devouring my heart
Will  I pass on to  Aaru
Or will  I be condemned?
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I must be back on time
But still  I want to know
I hope they let me go
I'm from another time
And  I must reunite
My body and my soul
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
Osiris,  Anubis
The underworld is yours
Osiris,  Anubis
I put my soul in your hands
O thou of countless names
Who are one and all things
O thou of countless names
Without beginning, without end
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Egypt, come back to me
Egypt, come back to me
Egypt, without beginning or end
Back in  Tennessee
I saw a family haunted by an entity
It was a tragedy in another century
Oh, they never would know the  Evil one that came
Little  Betsy, the age of 12
Living in a dream, the first one to scream
Invisible hands
Leaving their mark in the dark
Night after night
The  Bell  Witch attacked and attacked
Torturing  Betsy
Until a circle was held in candle light
Tell us who you are?
Please tell us who you are?
I am the air you breathe
I am the  Bell  Witch
I am a million years
I am the  Bell  Witch
The  Bell  Witch decided
It was the time for the father to scream
Soon taken ill
Never again to leave his bed alive
Tell us who you are?
Please tell us who you are?
I am the air you breathe
I am the  Bell  Witch
I am a million years
I am the  Bell  Witch
Goodnight  John, see you in  Hell
Say, bye, bye to daddy,  Betsy
Call the doctor,  I made sure
Call the doctor, there ain't no cure
That night  John, he died
And the  Bell  Witch never came again
Soon they realized
The witch had given  John bad medicine
Do you remember the bridge? The bridge that was standing in ruin
Do you remember the sign? Demons and witches were doing
They say it's a bad place
They say it's a magic place
Deep down under
The soil of this unholy land
Deep down under
The roots of a tree they have damned
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
Nothing will grow in the ground
The  Old  Oak is killing it all
If you are ever around
Beware of the  Oak and its charm
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
The  Old  Oak might make you blind
The  Old  Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized...
It's a bad sign
When the  Autumn comes and the leaves are gone
Oh it's a bad sign
The  Oak must feed in order to breed
Bad sign.......  Bad sign
It's a bad sign when the  Autumn comes
And the leaves are gone
It's a nightmare found
I wonder... what made this magic tree so
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Another season in another century
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Blood from the madmen we hung in that tree
Blood to the ground
Blood to the roots....  Red
All around the  Old  Oak
Deep into the ground they buried them
Indians of ancient times
Saw it as a holy shrine
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
Must have been a mighty  G O D
To receive a gift of life
All the people must have known
Happiness would come if sown
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
The  Old  Oak might make you blind
The  Old  Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized.....
No!  Don't hang with me
As  I go back to the  Old  Oak tree
When the darkness eats away the day
And the moon bears witness to the graves
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
Can you see the ghosts above our heads?
We are all in there with the dead
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
In the darkness there is no holding back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight
In the land of mystery we share
You can come along if you dare
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
We are hiding in the shadows on your wall
We are watching as you kiss your little doll
When the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see the light no more
No more
We are always in the shadows by your door
But when the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see the light no more
No more
There is no holding back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight
Everything is so strange in here
And as  I look through your eyes
I can see what you're thinking of me
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
All your secrets are done my dear
And as  I look through your eyes
I can see all the things that you fear
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
Solo:  Shermann
I'm the dreams you don't wanna

I'm the things you don't wanna see
I'm the dreams you don't wanna

I am the night of sin.....
Solo:  Denner
I wanna see you in tears
The end is near.....
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
I've come to give you a gruesome time
For all the evil you have done
I'll keep a coming until the end
I'll keep a coming back my friend
The mansion was right on the shore
Down by the lake
Nobody had lived here before
But the  Devil himself
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
They would all arrive in time
Solo:  Shermann
They gathered around the mansion
Thirteen in all
They had the same intention
Never to fall
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
Promising eternal life
So you want to be alive forevermore
I will turn the wheel of time
None of you will ever have to die
I will turn the wheel of time
Turning the wheel
Turning the wheel of time
But first we must play a game
The game of souls
Sit down!  Don't move around!
Deal those cards!
They played all night 'till the morning
Light
And the  Devil, he smiled on his own
They played all night for eternal life
Or the chance of losing their souls
High will win, low is the sin
They played all night in the burning
Light
The thirteen were sharing a nine
High will win, low is the sin
The final card was in the  Devil's hand
The  King of  Diamonds would win
Solo:  Denner
Solo:  Shermann
They could never leave the mansion
Forever inside
They had lost their souls of creation
But they were alive
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
And the mansion was mine
I'm an undertaker
I'm a ghost in the night
I'm a coffin shaker
This graveyard site is mine
Take a look at the sky
See that evil eye
Tonight the moon is cold as ice
Oh, yeah, cold as ice, oh, yeah
There's a black horse waiting
Will he be on time?
The graveyard's shaking
Should  I turn my eyes and walk away
Take a look at the sky
See that evil eye
Tonight the headless rider rides
Midnight
Let the church bell ring
It's midnight,  All  Hallow's  Eve
It's midnight,  All  Hallow's  Eve
I see him rising from his grave
I see him rising from his grave
On  All  Hallow's  Eve
Never to forget
He rides the open field
In search of his head
My  God, he's so grotesque
Should  I stay?
My  God, a scythe in his hand
No way
He's coming,  I'm running
He's coming,  I'm running
Deep inside  I know  I'm the one
He's coming,  I'm running
Deep inside  I know this is wrong
Help me,  I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm looking up
I'm in a grave
In this hollow grave
I can smell that he's near
Will  I ever never make it?
Will  I shed a tear?
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
In this hollow grave
I see a bony hand
Don't you ever never take it
It's the key to his land
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
No
The mind in my headless body
Seems to be chained to the inside
I cannot move towards the light
And as he rides away
Leaving me with this curse
I hear his laughter in the distance
Actually it's my laughter
He stole my head
Does this mean  I'll be the one next year?

The son of a shepherd,  Abdul  Alhazred
Travelling in the mountains, the mountains to the east
One night before him there stood that giant rock
3 symbols carved in blood
He built a fire at its root
To protect him from the wolves
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, it was in his hands
Later that same night
Awoken by wolfen's cry
The  Arab cold with fear
Saw the rock began to rise, rise
The son of a shepherd,  Abdul  Alhazred
Shivering he saw them coming, the mountain's evil priests
Black robes came together, around the floating rock
3 symbols in the dark
They all started chanting ancient songs
It was prayer in unknown tongue
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, it was in his hands
Daggers held high to the sky
The chanting had turned to screams
From the pit where the rock had been
8 snake-like monsters came
And the symbols burned in red
And the priest had turned their heads
The blood running from their chests and daggers
Had the  Arab scream in horror giving himself away
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, had to run away
Run down that mountain side
But they had seen him
The priests had caught his scent
Running faster, they're chasing him
Can't go no faster, they're still behind
Ah no, they're closing in
This house is full of hate
This house is full of madness
This house is deep insane
This house was never mine
Deep in the dark, you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
All of the deadly kisses
All of the sick, sick, sickness
All of the broken mirrors
It's here to stay forever
Deep in the dark, you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
Come along, come along
Meet my demon, demon
My demon, demon
The poison deep within
I can't let him out again
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
So here we go again
Digging the knife in
Who will be next?
Who will be our guest?
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
Who will be next?
Who will be our guest?
I hate that goddamn cellar
I wish  I never went there
It always was and will be
I cannot,  I cannot make it go away
Deep in the dark you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
Come along, come along
Meet my demon, demon
My demon, demon
The poison deep within
I can't let him out again
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
So here we go again
Be my guest

You believe in heaven
You believe the devil is here
When you ring your demon bell
You think  I'll end up in hell
Oh, yeah, you're the preacher
You're the devil
You're the preacher
Hiding in the underworld, that's you
I can't wait to see your final show

On a magical misty morning
I was standing in the autumn rain
Suddenly the birds fell silent
Would  I ever hear them sing again?
Hear them sing again
Without a word of warning
I saw a shadow in the autumn rain
Just like in my nightly dreams
The lady in black had come again
The lady had come again
Begging me to follow her
Into the misty rain
Begging me to follow her
Into the no more pain
Her eyes were hypnotizing
Burning deep inside my brain
The lady in black was here now
She was here to take me far away
Take me far away
Follow me to the other side
Through the tunnel of light we travel
Fading away
Through the tunnel of light we travel
We're fading away
Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
The girl in the mirror, she's not really there
Only  I can see her, in all her misery
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Can't you feel it, those haunting eyes?
She's so divine, could be magic of a kind
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Take a look in the mirror
Deep inside there's a world of its own
Take a look in the mirror
See what you might find
Try to reach my hand
Try to reach through the glass, try, try
' Cause the longest journey is the one on your own
If we break the mirror, do you think they'll let you go
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Why am  I here in a quiet mortuary?
A lady and the man, flowers in their hands
Nobody sees me,  I don't understand
Nobody hears me, seems like  I don't exist
Seems like no one can hear me as  I scream
I do not feel the way  I used to be
Could it really be that the one  I see is me?
You gotta tell me why people come but never stay?
Could it really be that the one  I see is me?
Does it really matter, oh, do you really care?
Why am  I here in a quiet mortuary?
Listen to the bell, calling my name
Nobody sees me, calling my name
Nobody hears me as  I scream
Why do  I feel like  I've been left behind?
Could it really be  I'm in the afterlife?
You gotta tell me, why  I feel like  I've been left behind?
Could it really be  I'm in the afterlife?
Does it really matter, oh, do you really care?
Somewhere in ancient  Spain
Close to what was  Baecula
There lay  Castillo  Del  Mortes
To be known as ' House of the dead'
Oh, no, oh, not here
A fool was playing with magic
Magic he did not understand
He opened the unholy gates
Letting out the ancient ones from hell
Six hundred people
Standing on the castle walls
Screaming for mercy
Someone must have heard their calls
Six hundred people
Wondering what's going on
Two armies in the sky
Forming and in battle line
Hear the battle cries
Seven cohorts of angels
Fighting for the elders to win
Seven cohorts of angels
Fighting for the people within
The ' House of the dead'
Soon to be buried in sin
Nine units of demons
The ancient ones command
Nine units of demons
The ancient ones will stand
The ' House of the dead'
Will soon be buried in sin
Six hundred were watching in horror
As they began to fight
None of the armies were using a weapon
As it is known to man
Demons and angels were falling in numbers
Out of the burning sky, the burning sky
Retreat, retreat, oh, the angels flee
Defeat, defeat, the battle's over, it's done
Somewhere in ancient  Spain
Close to what was  Baecula
There lay the battleground
Where many an angel was slain
Nine units of demons
Bringing unbearable sin
Nine units of demons
Coming for the people within
The ' House of the dead'
Will soon live up to its name
Six hundred people
Running deep inside
Six hundred people
Trying to hide
From the ancient ones
But there's nowhere to run on this day
There is no need to speak of the horrible fate
Bestowed upon the six hundred from  Baecula
Our father who art in  Hell
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom is come
Thy will is done
On earth as it is in  Hell
We take this night our rightful due
And trespass not on the path of  He
Lead us unto temptation
And deliver us from false piety
For thine is the  Kingdom
And the  Power
And the  Glory
Forever
Shemhamforash!
There's a little old man, standing by my window
There's a little old man, hiding in the shadows
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man,  I'd say he looks like  Misery
There's a little old man,  I could really use his company
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
Come inside and stay for a little while
Come in from the cold and warm your heart
Come inside and tell me who you are
Come in from the cold and warm your heart
" You would not know of me, we never met before
The name is  Damian and  I used to live in this house"
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man...  I'd say he looks like  Misery
There's a little old man...  I could really use his company
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
So,  I said farewell until we meet again
You can come again my friend, any day you want
I later learned that he was never here
I later learned that he'd been dead a year
The uninvited
Walking on a cold and white  December night
I hear the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Do you still remember the old oak tree?
I do, the feeling's coming back to me
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
I took her hand and then we walked into the night
I took her hand and then we watched the moon go by
Memories of long forgotten times
I took a chance to relive my life and then  I saw her, she smiled
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
The same
Walking on a cold and white  December night
I hear, the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
Up in the hills where the sun goes down
There's an old black church and a broken town
The sun goes down
The trees are dead and the river is dry
And they blame it all on the old belfry
The devils cry
Why?  Why?  Why?  Listen to the bell
Why?  Why?  Why?
Listen to the bell and it just might tell you why
It's a dark and lonely road to the old belfry
And if you're alone, you'll never survive... No.. No.. No
Deep...in the shadows
Everywhere  I hear the devils cry
Why?  Why?  Do the devils cry?
Why?  Why?  Why?  Do the devils cry?
I have seen the gateway that leads beyond
So far away from the burning sun
I've seen the  Maker,  I've seen the  Taker
I've seen whatever you call them there
The blazing ruby eyes in the old belfry
Listen to the bell if you wanna know why
You gotta listen to the bell
And then you just might hear the sound of  Hell
Why?... Why?... Why?... You gotta tell me why
Why?... Why?  Why do the devils cry?
Why?... Why?  Why do the devils cry?
1640, the  Caribbean sea
The wind was just a breeze
Heading for a western shore, the barque was sailing east
Close hauled into the eye
The unicorn was riding high on the tide
And the rum went down their throats, with a twist of wine
Just after midnight, nobody saw the  Antigua shore
Just after midnight, nobody heard the thunder roar
Oh, they were heading straight for the reefs
Just after midnight, they were caught by the storm
1640, the  Caribbean sea
The wind was not just a breeze
The captain and the crew were fighting for their lives
But they didn't stand a chance with their drunken minds
Going down, to their watery graves
Going down, going down
Fifteen men and a bottle of rum
It's the captain and the crew of the unicorn
Listen hard on a stormy night
And you just might hear them singing that rhyme
Oh yeah, a ghost that never dies
Fifteen men and a bottle of rum
It's the captain stuck in the unicorn
Oh yeah, a ghost that never dies
It's a warning, storm is coming
Yeah, you better look out
Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the lights go dim
While  I dig into your soul my friend
Looking for sin, sin, sin, looking for sin, sin
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the show begin
While we look into the southern wind
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Someone here will not survive the night that's creeping by
This is your time, not mine, for another life, don't you see
Don't you see, you took a chance, now you must pay
Say your last goodbye, this is your time, not mine
For another life, now die, die, die
It is so much colder in here
Hold on to your soul my dear
It is so much colder in here
Hold on to nothing
Ooh, ooh
Who should  I let go?  Who needs to know?
The journey of a lonely soul
Now you're on your own, yeah
The maker's waiting down the road
The dying has begun
Now my finger points at you
It is time for you to pay what's due
Now my finger points at you
And you must know what you never ever knew
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Now my finger points at you, and you must know
What you never ever knew
There is something out there waiting for me
With an evil glow
There is something out there that will
Never let me go
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
I have seen the  Southern witches, in the church of  God
I have seen the  Southern witches, and the  Holy  Ghost
Dancing, blasphemous, waiting for him to call
Dancing, blasphemous, uniting them all
And  I know this night so well
Cause  I have walked from here to hell
The only thing  I can never tell
Is why they put me under the spell
Under the spell
Was it the deadly moon that gave me away
On  Walpurgis  Night
Was it the deadly moon that gave me away
Or the evil eye
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
And then he came at last
Suddenly the  Earth was shaking
And  I,  I couldn't feel a thing as  I saw him
Standing on the altar
He was drinking all the wine
While the  Holy  Ghost and the  Southern witches
Were turning every single cross around and upside down
I never should have been there
I never should have seen it
I never should have understood
Lie down in your dead, little baby
You know it's getting late
Listen to this deadtime story
And hold on to your head
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Little blood  Red  Riding  Hood
Was passing through the woods
A basket full of poisoned fruit
She's absolutely way too cute
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Good old  Nick is in her blood
And it makes me feel so hot
Devil eyes, that's no surprise
She's colder than ice
The werewolf's hiding
With its yellow glowing eyes
Drooling for baby blood
He's jumping in the night
And he knows where  Red is riding
He knows here  Grandma well
That big bad werewolf's got it down
He cannot fail
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Grandma's waiting in here dead
For sweetest  Little  Red
When she ate the werewolf's head
You could not even tell
There is no way out, there's no way out
For sweetest  Little  Riding  Hood
' Cause  Granny won't be full
Until  Red is dead and gone, bye, bye
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water,  I guess  I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the devil's well and then  I'll go to hell
I'd rather drink from the devil's well
And then  I will go straight to hell, ohh, yeah
High on the mountain of  Poltersberg there is a quiet lake They say it's full of demons, that  Satan keeps them there
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
Cast a stone into this lake and soon a storm will rise
And suck out all the demons, up into the sky
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
Ohh, holy water, ohh, holy water
I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water,  I guess  I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the devil's well and then  I'll go to hell
I'd rather drink from the devil's well
And then  I will go straight to hell, ohh, yeah
Deep in the valley of  Blankenstein there is a sacred pool
They say that you can drink this water, it's cleansing of the soul
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
I don't want that holy water, no, no, no, no, no
It makes me burn inside
I don't want that holy water, ohh, no
Someone better come and save my life
Someone better kill those evil eyes
Is it in my mind or are they still behind?
Turning slowly,  I see,  I see,  I see there's no one there
Ohh, someone better tell me what it's all about?
In the dying fire, moonlight has struck my eye
I feeling colder,  I see,  I see,  I see the amulet
Of evil gods, evil gods
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu
Traveling for years in the mountain side
Traveling for years to believe in the sign
And  I know them well now, all of the ancient ones
Eyes turning slowly,  I see,  I see,  I see there's no one there
Ohh, someone must have broken the holy seal
' Cause  I know they're there, just like that fateful night
I feeling colder,  I see,  I see,  I see the amulet
Of evil gods, evil gods
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu
Hear me as  Kutulu raises his evil head
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow,  I might be of the dead
I'm burning up,  I'm burning up
I wish for you, the gods will be merciful
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow,  I might be of the dead
I'm burning up,  I'm burning up
I wish for you, the gods will be merciful
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In  London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when  I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when  I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if  I'm near
I'm sly and  I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for " The  Ripper"
Or if you like " Jack  The  Knife"
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper...the ripper....the ripper
Anna... was praying to a god
She had betrayed, so they said
Some folk had seen her flying on a broom
All hallows eve, under the moon
The inquisitor had left her behind
Gone for a bite, food on his mind
The sun was slowly trying to hide
Behind a town so full of pride
A sight anna would never see again
Torture in the name of christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of christ, you witch you... confess
Solo: shermann
Sitting naked on the wooden horse
Weights to her legs, what a holy cross
Her bloody hands tied to her back
Her golden hair burned to black
Thumbscrews they had used
To crush each tip of her fingers to a pulp
In the torture chamber, she couldn't feel much more
Of anything... anymore
Torture in the name of christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of christ, you witch you... confess
Satan's mark... had slipped away
They already searched her body twice today
And it was all in vain
Oh anna here they come again
Off the horse, strapado for a friend
Up she goes, higher and higher
Anna's crying, screaming: "liars"
Solo: shermann-wead
Confess, confess witch
Confess, before you die
"yes, yes, i am a witch, may satan take you all"
Solo: wead
They dropped her from the ceiling
To a foot above the floor
Her ams and legs disjointed
Screams of pain... then finally no... more
Old  Nick is by my side,  I hear no evil
As  I walk into the night,  I see no evil
Old  Nick is by my side,  I feel no evil
Oh...  I'm gonna love this night... it's gonna be just fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
Old  Nick... my imaginary friend
Old  Nick is not what they say, here we go again
Through the dark on a snake we ride, the  Devil's child
Oh... the moon is bright, she's oh so fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is,  The  Night
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is,  The  Night
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Looking through a  Demon's eye
We're gonna spy on  God
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is
Solo:  Shermann
Old  Nick is by my side,  I feel no evil
Oh...  I'm gonna love this night... it's gonna be just fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
The  Night
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is,  The  Night
Find out if hee really is
Find out if she really is,  The  Night...
On this cold and windy  Sunday
I'm sitting here alone...  It's  Autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever
Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember... the days...
When we were young
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
I have been reading your letter, over and over again
I can't believe you're gonna be here today
I can't believe... this is  Sunday
How nice of you to come, it's been so way too long
Let me get you another glass of wine
To keep our tingues in time
Solo:  Wead
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
So many things have never been told
And now the both of us are way too old
Solo:  Shermann
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
Like the light of the sun
You used to brightened my day
But darkness ha taken your place
And  I can no longer keep it away
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
I ask you for one last time
No there won't be any wine
Just one more time
So you can put flowers on my grave
And then leave again... since forever
Many have seen the statue that cries
But only  I have seen her at night
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say that her... tears can heal you, but
When the sun goes down, and my day begins
That's when  I saw her change
Her tears did turn to blood, just like a miracle
And through her mouth of stone,  I saw the fire
From so deep inside,  I heard a voice from  Hell
" I am the lady who cries,  I am he who lights the night"
" I am  Lucifer"
Solo:  Shermann
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say ther her... tears can heal you, but
From so deep inside,  I hear a voice from hell
" I am the lady who cries,  I am he who fights the night"
Solo:  Wead
" I'm your eternal friend"
" Let my children come to me at day
Let my children come to me and pray"
Solo:  Wead
" They don't know who  I am
Or that they worship the  Devil
They don't know who  I am
They think  I'm a miracle..."
I heard it... in my sleep last night
I heard it... in your sleep last night
Now  I can hear it again, outside the night is sad
I know it's not the wind, outside the night is black
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
I know that,  I must tell you a lie
I know that, it could be you and not  I
Before the sun is rising, the  Banshee cannot stay
Before the night is dying, a life will slip away
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
I must light a fire, to chase away the night
Let us hold each other tight
The cats are gone,  I guess... they know
Oh... they know what's gonna come
Solo:  Wead
The wailing is so much louder,  I need to hold you tight
I can feel you getting colder, is it time for you or  I?
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
Let it be me
Poisonous  Mandrake, you danerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
White  Mandragora, with you root so thick, you are the male
Black as the night on the outside, inside you're like a moon
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am  I losing my mind?
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
In the olden days it was believed
That in the dark of night, you had to
Tie a string from the neck of a
Black dog to the  Mandrake root, then move away, move away
And with meat you must lure the dog
To pull the  Mandrake root from the ground
Cover your ears... cause the cry of the  Mandrake root
No man has ever survived, the dog will surely die
Solo:  Wead
Poisonous  Mandrake, you dangerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am  I losing my mind?
Mandrake root, bring me your poisonous love
Mandrake root,  I need you to bring me that love
Mandrake root...  Mandrake root bring me love
Mandrake root, bring me that poisonous thing
That everyone is calling  L O V E
I can see it in your mystery eyes
I can feel it on your breath tonight
The yearning for time, the yearning for eternal life
Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood, oh... oh... oh
Let me look you deep in the eyes
Let me look... into your mind
Let me take you to a room full of life
Let me, let me, let me suck your wine
Oh...oh...oh...sucking your blood
Oh...oh...oh...sucking you, sucking your blood
A  Chandelier is our source of light
I'm breathing in the golder air tonight
Time... is right, it's your innocent skin  I like
Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood, oh... oh... oh
Your neck is so delicately white, inviting my mouth for the bite
My teeth... your vein, like wine from a chalice  I drink
Oh...oh...oh...sucking your blood
Oh...oh...oh...sucking you, sucking your blood
Solo:  Shermann
Your warm juices colour my throat
What unheavenly joy, turning yours into mine
Me... part of you, oh you are the wine
Sucking your blood before the night is torn
How could this ever, ever be a sin
If you would pull the stake from my heart
If you would let me draw another card
Maybe the  Morning  Star will blind our eyes
Maybe the  Morning  Star will bless another night
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Maybe the  Morning  Star will blind our eyes
Maybe the  Morning  Star will bless another night
Me... part of you, you are the wine
Why do  I keep on doing this?  It's not for me anymore
I'm doing this more for you than  I
And on that lonely road to nowhere
I lost myself to something else
I don't know where  I'm going or where  I've been
It's so hard to remember all the things  I am, am  I?
It feels like the end is near, catching up with me
Catch me if you can, cause  I'm going down into the ground
How much longer can  I keep going on?
I can feel my lost ones coming down
Sooner than later,  I'll see you all again
I feel my purpose here slipping away
I see the sun, but it's raining
I hope  I'm on my way to better things
And if  I'm not, it doesn't really matter
Cause  I am doing this more for you than  I am me
I can no longer pretend, that my life is worth living
I...  I would rather die, be dead again
Hold on
Now here it comes, death for one, a lonely son
Up then down,  I'm spinning around
My sould is so confused again
Am  I floating towards the sun?
Hold on, am  I dead on?
Solo:  Shermann
Through a tunnel of black, why?
Why do  I feel so sad?
I've been waiting for the end of act 9 to come
The curtain must fall, the end of a song
Solo:  Wead
But the song goes on and on
The light is so very strong
I'm drifting along,  I have no will
I'm drifting still
In a room without walls...  I feel the chill
No one is here to pick me up
Nothingess... what a mess... oh
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?  I'm talking to you, do you hear me?
If  I could only see through the wall of nothingness
The wall of black
They gave me number 9, this is not like the last time
Number 9
This time  I am really losing my mind
I hear an orchestra...  I see an orchestra
I greet an orchestra...  I meet an orchestra
I'm in an orchestra...  I am an orchestra
I kill this orchestra...  I kill me?  No
No don't stop, oh please don't stop
Hey stay here, what's going on?... hey wait for me
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
I'm running but  I can't keep up
Then  I realize my feet are gone
This is such a weird weird song
The orchestra is now a door
One is one and two is four,  I can see three more
Seven doors, seven doors
I must choose one before they're gone
But  I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
But  I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
The number 6-6, the number 6-6-6
The number 6-6-6
The number 6-6-6, that's my door
Wuauuu... look at all the colours
There goes an orchestra, no more doors
Close the window, here they come
I hear another end of this song
But again the song goes on
Dead again,  I know cause  I've been here before
I'm dead agin, if  I could only reach that door
The number 6-6-6, the number 6-6-6
I'm beginning to miss you again
Why can't  I just get you out of my mind...
I must forget
Dead again,  I know cause  I've been here before
I'm dead again, if  I could only reach that door
Through a purple mist the light is fading
I guess  I'll have to stay dead
A little longer this time
Dead again...
In the mirror...  I have seen  H I M
And he scares me
The crature... behind the mask  I wear
I know his name is  F E A R
In the mirror... he's looking back at me
I have to face him every day
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
The man... in the mirror, he scares me
For  I know him not so well
The creature... behind the mask  I wear
I know his name is  F E A R
In the mirror... it's not omy eyes  I see
But they are always there
I cannot let it show,  N O  O N E must ever know
The horror that lies so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
Solo:  Wead
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What  I need to know
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What  I'm longing for
Only the creature... living inside of me
Could show me the meaning of life
I cannot let it show,  N O  O N E must ever know
The horror that lives so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
You are  Selene, the moon in heaven
You are  Persephone,  Queen of the  Underworld
Hecate... darkness and terror of the night
Hecase... oh, the crossroads are thine
You are  Diana, you are the hunter of souls
The dogs are howling, we dogs know when you approach
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight, oh let us ride
Solo:  Shermann
At the crossroads, they buried criminals and suicides
At the crossroads, any traveller could lose a life
A suitable place, for making a pact with the  Devil
A suitable place, for us to hold the sabbath
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride in the dead of night...
Even you mortals can ride with her at night
And join the night-flying demons, oh you and  I
Listen to their tales of wandering ghosts
Listen to their tales of forgotten times
Listen to their tales of the crossroads
Listen to their tales of forgotten lives
I'm surrounded by darkness, I'm dying in my bed
I don't know if  I'm going to survive
I open my eyes,but it's so hard to see
My  Last  Rites
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
In a flick of a second  I think  I saw a priest
Listening to my breathing getting weaker all the time
He's mumbling words  I don't understand
My  Last  Rites
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
Feeling colder,feeling low
My blood still running,but running slow
Oh no... I don't need no priest of yours...oh  Christ
I won't listen to another word from you
Here  I am dying and you act the fool
I wish you'd come a little closer
So  I can reach your cross and end your prayer here
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
Oh  Father... did you speak to  God?
Oh  Father... did he speak to you?
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father... your eyes could heal the sick
Yeah, heal the sick
Oh  Father... no one could ever forget
Oh  Father... the night your eyes went black
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father...  God left you for dead
It was a black year for the  Church of  Saint  Anne
It was a black year when the miracles began
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
The sick got sicker and the well got ill
Your congregation said you lost " God's will"
You ran to the altar, said another prayer
You ran to the altar, but  God was never there
So they threw you out, and stoned you down
Stoned you down to the ground
It was a black year for the  Church of  Saint  Anne
It was a black year when the miracles began
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father... betrayed by your own
Oh  Father... did  Satan take your soul?
They found him in the tower hanging from the bell
A twisted smile on his face as if he came straight from  Hell
" If thine eyes deceive thee, pluck them out"
I sold my soul to you, I sold my soul to the  Devil his due
I... I sold my soul
I sold my soul,and  I sold yours too " To the  Devil we're due"
Ohhh... I sold my soul
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you...to the  Devil his due
I sold my soul
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no!
No point in turning around,just live with the fear
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you
To the  Devil his due
So many angels were falling from the sky
So many angels would have to die...
A black candle in my hand,a pact between  God and man
Oh your  Majesty,this time  I have to know
I sold my soul to you, I sold my soul to the  Devil his due
I... I sold my soul
I sold my soul,and  I sold yours too " To the  Devil we're due"
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you...to the  Devil his due
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no!
No point in turning around,just live with the fear
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you
To the  Devil his due
So many angels were falling from the sky
So many angels would have to die...
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
If you dare then come with me
To the  House on the  Hill and you will see
Nothing is what it seems  In the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
While you were asleep
Another friend of mine has come from the  Keep
The well in the cellar my dear -  That's how  I keep them near
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
In my little shrine
I keep the stillborn to be born another time
The souls that  God didn't hear - oh  I keep them near
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
It is so very strange,to live among the stillborn
It is so very strange,to keep their souls away from harm
I was one of the mentally ill,who stayed in a cell of his own
I was one of the mentally ill,who used to call this home
Oh you're not alone
All your sins are forgiven
In the name of  Jesus in heaven... Ahhh
There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking...that  God would understand
Satan take him to where you dwell
Satan take him to burn in hell
Always were a believer
You never thought of  God as the  Deceiver... Ahhh
There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking...that  God would understand
Satan take him to where you dwell
Satan take him to burn in hell
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Where is your  Jesus now, Jesus in  Heaven
Where is your saviour of all
He's executing your soul
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Jesus and  Satan hand in hand
Leading you down the stairway to the damned
No more pearly gates for you
Eternal flames,wondering who is who... Ahhh
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Where is your  Jesus now, Jesus in  Heaven
Where is your saviour of all
He's executing your soul
Burn  In  Hell... Burn  In  Hell
There is a cemetary just  East of here
That's where they say the  Devil,the  Devil is always near

I see little demons,are they in my head?
I see little demons,fightin in my bed
Why did  I go insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
Screams in the night, I hear another one died
Was it number 9,or was it me who cried
Why did  I go insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
When  I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank
My brain is burning up, Insanity...
When  I look in the mirror,my mind is, Dead
Is it me on the other side?
I saw the look on your face,the night they took me away
Not a tear,not a trace,just stood there waving goodbye
Dead roses in my room,a love that died too soon
When  I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank
My brain is burning up, Insanity...
When  I look in the mirror,my mind is, Dead
Sanity turned  Insane, I hange myself in a picture frame
I'm so tired,let me sleep
I'm counting demons...
Why did  I go  Insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
Oh doctor kill the pain,oh doctor kill the pain
Kiss the little  Demon, hanging on my wall
Kiss the little  Demon, he will answer your call
You better watch out... God forsaken heaven
I am alone in the dark when  I call the  Demon's name
I  Am... Am  I the one who's insane?
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let  Him taste a little of your blood
Kiss the little  Demon,hanging on my wall
Kiss the little  Demon,he will answer your call
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let  Him taste a little of your blood
I send you my  Demon to blacken his brain
I send you my  Demon to rip out his veins
Rise from  Hell and serve me well
Rise... Demon rise
You better watch out... God forsaken heaven
I am alone in the dark when  I call the  Demon's name
I  Am... Am  I the one who's insane?
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let him taste a little of your life
A little of your blood
A little of your soul
The poison is still in your veins
The poison  I slipped in your drink
Cannot see me,  I am but a ghost
Never saw your dangerous host
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
All you can see in the darkness above
Is the white in my eye...
I'm standing on the edge of your grave
Looking down into the eyes of the dead
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
How does it feel with my foot on your chest?
How does it feel? ( Tell me and  I might forget)
How does it feel to be so out of breath?
How does it feel? ( Tell me and  I might forget)
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
He started struggling, oh the fool
Moonlight shining in his drool
I slammed the shovel straight between his eyes
" Stay down,"  I screamed, " You're here to die!"
Never saw me,  I am but a ghost
Never saw your dangerous host
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
All you can see in the darkness above
Is the white in my eye
I'm standing on the edge of your grave
Looking down into the eyes of the dead
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
No matter what it is you believe
You're lucky if you die in your sleep
" Murder!" he screamed, " Oh why!?" but that's a lie
You killed me first, so now die
I'm dead, but you die,  I'm gonna bury you alive
" Murder!" he screamed, " Oh why?!"
In hell

Heaven...heavenly hell
We are 9
Good and evil,dark and light
We are 9,9 we are
I am 9...you are 9...we are 9

In the end it's all the same
Who are we to play their game
We are 9

Time has disappeared into an unknown evil
In heaven? heaven...heavenly hell

Riding on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sitting in leather, riding on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again
No, he won't
You were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
My social workers got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name
Yes, it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks run out next week
It won't be very long till  I'm back
On the streets again
Now, now you were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?

Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes,  I am
I'm gonna ride on you, baby
I hear the sound in a metal way
I feel the power rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Baby,  I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute  I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby,  I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Currie says we're on the edge
He says, man you're really graphic
This band's a social wedge
We all got hearts made of metal
And our blood's hot molten rock
And if  I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
So mister  D. J., play just one for me
You know the one with the crushing
And the screams
Cause only one thing really sets me free
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, loud as it can be
Mama's having problems, always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you  I'm a loser cause  I like being free
The truth is in the mirror, it's what they never see
I said, yeah, a long time ago
They tried to tell me, son, keep our daughter home
I said no, no, no, no
Now,  I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying for me
A fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
Only sixteen, a woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world
Pick you up on  Friday when your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on  Sunday
When he's watching  Billy  Graham on  T V
He won't see me
Now, do it right with music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
Now,  I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying for me
A fast taker
Right here's where  I'm staying
Life's a game  I play for keeps
Fast taker, bed breaker
Love maker, take it away
I don't know
Well, 
there's no charge for the haircut And the bullets come free
My uncle  Sam send a letter, said
Got a mission for me
Now,  I'm a ranger not a stranger
And  I live in  Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that  I've lost my mind
Baby, it's not gone just a little hard to find
About the time this letter gets home
I'll be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that  I'm 
M. I. A
Think a little less about me each day
Cause if  I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a 
B. A. R
I know  I'm home
But  I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world  I'm brave
The businessmen sat home
Well,  I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa, alright
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
We met on  English ground In a backstage room we heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew soon the time
Would come for us to fight
Destination now in sight
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands and take a stand
Look sharp when duty calls
Where we march, cities fall
And the strong survive and take our side
Now the time has come for us to fight
Target waiting in our sights
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar, born to live forevermore
Manowar, born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forevermore
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eyes
Took his land and fortune
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline
Left for the tide
Sees his lifeblood leaving
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the  Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
And in the world above
The elders sing
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring
He was met at the gate of  Hades
By the  Guardian of the  Lost  Souls, the  Keeper of the  Unavenged
And  He did say to him
" Let you not pass, abandon
Return to the world from whence you came
And seek payment, not only for thine own anguish
But vindicate the souls of the  Unavenged"
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him
Called  Vengeance, forged in brimstone
And tempered by the woeful tears of the  Unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world
They brought forth their  Demon horse called  Black  Death
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire
And on that night they rose up from  Hell
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood  I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On  Black  Death  I ride
When kissed by the sword of  Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that  I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get their lives
But when  I'm through they know they must pay
With their lives, with their lives
By moonlight, we ride
Ten thousand side by side
With swords drawn, held high
Our whips and armor shine
Hail to thee, our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gone are the days, when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's wake
The sense of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the battle, we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men die
We crossed a starlit sky
And still, no space and time
We'll catch the wind
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Wait, listen Hey, what, what's this supposed to be? She's only sixteen Come here you Hey, she wanted it, man
When you see me coming
Flying down the road
You know  I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yeah, got me some leather
Leather is my skin
Black and chrome flashing
Through the town
Some call me the warlord
Cause  I'm a goddamn fast machine
Young and hungry
Not too proud and mean
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Take what  I want and  I go where  I please
Got the world right by the balls
This world ain't big enough
To keep me down
Yeah, we're living in a sick world
The man on the  T V said we got
Lots of trouble overseas
Well, what the  Hell do  I care?
You think they care about me?
Stop sending money
Send them all a bomb
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Born to live in a fast lane
On a chopped up  Harley  D
Smell that oil and high test gasoline
Never got a shortage of girls
To share my seat
Well, they all want to know
What people say is true
You know, get a biker started
And he'll drive all damn night
Well, hold on, honey
Cause this ride's for a ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ain't never growing old
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Riding, riding, riding
Ride, ride, ride
I'm the warlord of the road
Atop the mountain
Where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest
White was the snow
There as children
How could children know?
One without name or number
Soon would show
There stood he
On his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old
A scepter of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold, the creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear wisdom's voice
Rise, know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart, but never reveal
You were called by the  Gods
Their powers to wield
Guard well the secret of steel
A scepter of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold, the creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear wisdom's voice
Rise, know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart, but never reveal
You were called by the  Gods
Their powers to wield
Guard well the secret of steel
And the great sword of steel
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes
We rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads
Awaken to their dreams
The sound of metal
So loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors
Called the metal kings
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together, we are all
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together, we are all
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
Leather, metal, spikes and chains
Gloves of metal, raised to show the brave
Into the darkness
March the armies of the night
Bound by metal, we live the fight
We wear leather, we wear spikes
We rule the night
With hands high, fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high, forever we'll be there
Gloves of metal rule tonight
Valhalla, the  Gods await me
Open wide thy gates
Embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last farewell
To the  Viking land
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal,  I am there
I take my place by  Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing as  I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of  Odin onward ride
Valhalla, the  Gods await me
Open wide thy gates
Embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry
I taste your blood
As it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
I take your powers
To the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth, ye wicked
Know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside
My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
I crush your bones,  I kill your face
I rip your flesh,  I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world, the rats that race
My strength is hatred, torment and pain
Hatred, hatred
With heart filled hatred
Black blood runs through my veins
Hatred
Above the wreckage of your mortal world  I stand
Judgement passed, delivered by his hand
Now, clear the smoke
There the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man
What was written, foretold in dreams
In visions apocalypse now seen
And all self-righteous fools
Who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Dine with the  Beast
Vindication, he's coming on the clouds
See his  Angels Hear their trumpets sound
The day of anger
When the stars fall from the sky The moon turns red The sun turns black as night
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star
The four  Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
His hair as white as wool His eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last
He brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death For the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star
The four  Horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, 
the first trumpet blows Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail and fire on  Satan's throne
Revelation
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood
Fall on  Satan's throne
Ride, ride, ride
Ride up from  Hell
Armed with magic
Sons of  Demons and men
This song of greeting
Written for your tragic end
So long our stride
The world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Hot pitch and chain
Take to the air
Our ramming blades
Lay their ships hold bare
Steel meets steel
Axes, broadsword and shield
Their heads ride our spears
And bodies cover the fields
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Fallen brother, as  I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last
Mighty earth, now doth drink your blood
And  I remember days long past
Your sacrifice so great
Rest now, take thy sleep
For you shall not awake
Let revenge be sweet
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
For when we march
Your sword rides with me
You who killed my brother
And all who take your side
This be your last hour
Let your steel be tried
Now turn to face me
Upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can
Death is life
By the full moon they rise from their graves
Through seas of blood
Fighting with  Hell bent rage
Swear the creed of unity
By the circle of blood, we are one
We know not fear, born to fight, not run
Maim and kill them
Take the women and children
Three sons have  I and they ride by my side
The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names
We ride down my enemies on their half-hearted flight
No voice of mercy, no evangels of light
Mighty messengers, heathens rage
Witness our coming,  Gods of the death
I ride through the air,  I laugh as  I die
With powers of evil, dark knowledge is mine
The ride of the wicked, the first sin was trust
Kill without warning, for blood now  I lust
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Three sons have  I and they ride by my side
The fierce, the black and the wicked are their names
We ride down my enemies on their half-hearted flight
No voice of mercy, no evangels of light
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Strong winds, magic mist
To  Asgard the  Valkyries fly
High overhead, they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies
Passing through the storm led by  Demons
Walk between the world of men and  Gods
Cast no shadows, draw no light
I rape the priestess on pagan night
I taste the serpent's poison
On the lips of the one  I love
She brings this gift of witchcraft
I wear the cat skin gloves
Apples of youth when  I wrought mischief
Hung on a tree to rot in the sun
Reborn in the middle of the final orgy
A gift of slavery to the chosen one
Suicide, suicide, don't you know me?
Call to the master, he will come
He will bring our resurrection
Cloaked in darkness, he has won
Smoke from my sacrifice
Journey to the isle of the blessed
Grant my soul your glory, at nighttime,  I'm your guest
Only  I know why each dawn  I die
I die
Smoke from my sacrifice
Journey to the isle of the blessed
Grant my soul your glory, at nighttime,  I'm your guest
Only  I know why each dawn  I die
Hear what's written on the wind
We come to kill and kill again
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead
Ride through the gate of clouds
Stand on the open step
Run berserk, spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chains
None can harm us, not their fire, iron or steel
For we have the 
will to power
With power we will kill
Kill with power
Die, die
Kill with power
Die, die
Die
Kill with power
Die, die
Die, die
Die
To the war  God  Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shall remain
Yes, it will
On the blood of all our fathers
On their weapons we now swear
To avenge, not lament
Give 
the false ones
 death
Raise sails, head for the open sea with sails full of wind
Our hearts overflown with belief, the quest for the grail
To  England we sail with our steel, we bring what was lost
If lives are the cost, let it be
Strong she stands
Reaching her hand
Brave and grand
On  English ground we were born
Proudly we return to  English shores
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
We march from the hills down to  London  Town
Join, raise your hand or hide when we ride for the crown
The sign of the hammer and the black winds blow through the night
Long was our wait, our meeting with fate is tonight
Strong she stands
Reaching her hand
Brave and grand
On  English ground we were born
Proudly we return to  English shores
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Standing tall, one and all, light the hall
Years have passed
I've dreamed of this day
As we raise our hands
We proudly say
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Hail, hail to  England
Hail, hail, hail
Battle hymns did sound the call
You came to our side
You heard true metal Into glory ride
Come on
You stood beside us
The false ones cried
Your love is judgement
You gave us life
You wait in the rain
You walk through the snow
We give you our blood
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more
We have read your letters
We have heard your call
We were brought together
Cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal
So hard and wild and mean
You'll live forever
We were born from your belief
Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song
We want you to know
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more
Metal makes us strong
It makes us
Metal makes us strong
It makes us stronger, stronger
Stronger, stronger, stronger
Metal makes us strong
Let each note  I know play
Be a black arrow of death
Sent straight to the hearts
Of all those who play false metal
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show
And this last time looking back,  I'll see my home
For he awaits me, reaching for my soul
He calls my name and waves me on
The fallen one, he stands in flame
Well, the life that he has given
Full of riches and success has a price
That  I made good in blood to pay
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance
If  I falter on my way
And what  God has now forsaken
And man has never seen
Are the riches of the underworld below
All my years of earthly pleasures
Gave support unto the bridge
I now cross it giving him my soul
Dark lord,  I summon thee
Demanding the sacred right to burn in  Hell
Ride up on  Hell's hot wind
Face one more evil than thou
Take my lustful soul
Drink my blood as  I drink yours
Impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head, release all my evil
Lucifer is king, praise  Satan
I know the one who waits
Satan is his name
Across the bridge of death
There he stands in flame
I know the one who waits
Satan is his name
Across the bridge of death
There he stands in flame
He is my provider as  I walk into the void
For eternity  I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding
Obey him without question
Even walk among the living if  I'm told
Satan, don't forsake me
I wait for you to take me
Grant me wings and as your messenger
I'll fly
I made a rock'n'roll sin
When  I tried givin' in to
Make money had to turn down low
They said, " Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute
Get a haircut and buy small gear"
That's when  I turned to them and said
" Hold it, right there!"
Well it's more to me than just a job
And while  I'm playin' you won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey
Can you hear me say...
All men play on ten Never gonna turn down again All men play on ten Never gonna turn down
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220
Step back and let my fingers fly
While  I'm burning up my gear
There's a fire in your ear
That won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when  I hear the crowd roar
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream
Then  I run back to the power rack
And deck all of my gear
Well it's more to me than just a job
And while  I'm playin' you won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey
Can you hear me say...
Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot,  I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
And leave you in the morning feeling right
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I've been looking, you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide
Oh, your getting wet, your working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night you won't forget
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
Black clouds on the horizon Great thunder and burning rain His chariot pounding I heard the  Heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to  Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder,  God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never-ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants who died that day
He held up his hammer high
And called to  Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to  Odin and  Gods on high
And leave the mortal world
Thor the mighty,  Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds
Where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down
On one so strong
They cut but never change
What stood so long
Tall as a mountain
I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground,  I'm in the air,  I am all
I live in the hearts of men
I'm the call to greatness, not all can hear
I awaken the creator in those who dare
And the day will come when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain
I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
The spell has been broken
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind
On the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the  Gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Pounding, pounding
We're back from the dead
Those who denied us, are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph
And live by the sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
The spell has been broken
The curse has been lifted
Black is the wind
On the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the  Gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning, all stand aside
Old men and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites
False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
They'll find no sanctuary
Hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and the flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism
Linger after death
So hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain
Feel the dragon's breath
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath,  I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites
False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky,  Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath,  I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Thank you for the  Kool- Aid, reverend  Jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh, a sacrificial lamb
Were you our  God or a man in a play Who took our applause and forced us to stay?
Now all together, we lived as we died
On your command, by your side
Die by your side
Guyana, in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink, they're dying of thirst

Give us your word for the grand final stand

I wrote a letter to the  M. T. V
What's going on now?
Don't you care about me?
Sent the same letter to the radio
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it- Rock and  Roll
We all want it- On your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playing
It just ain't worth my saying
People want music to get them moving
We don't want labels
We want music on the table
We all like it- Rock and  Roll
We all want it-on your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll
We all like it- Rock and  Roll

We all want it-on your show
Play it loud,don't play it low
Blow your speakers with  Rock and  Roll
Blow your speaker... Rock and  Roll (repeated)
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And  I wait for the sun when all are one
I shall not betray
Calling at me,  I'm waiting
When all are led astray
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on for when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No-one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Coming at us, no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry on, my sons, forever
Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on
For as long as we're together then
Forever carry on
Yeah, be my brother
Fight to stay alive

Carry on, when  I am gone
Carry on, when the day is long
Forever carry on

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walking the streets
Scums have their day
'til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin' to me
I'am armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in nam shot up my friends
I'm back in the streets the fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But  I'll die like a man
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Now we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch and  I'm paying all
All my life  I been waitin'to see
Who's gonna win crumbs or me
Are you ready
My brother's still in da-nang
Puttin'an ad in the back of kerrang
I'm looking for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back the nam cause no one else will
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed
Violence and bloodsheed

I have seen the fire Of a thousand suns pass by While blasphemers spread their  Gospel Bearing false witness Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions, all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, holy war Holy, we are fighting Fighting a holy war Holy war, see us fly on winds of doom Holy war, baptised in fire and steel Holy war, for the end we bring is soon Holy war, now face the storm A holy war
Brothers of metal, know no masters
Metal's our religion, take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth, our dawn of glory
All reborn, we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep these dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land
Holy, holy war Holy, we are fighting Fighting a holy war Holy war, see us fly on winds of doom Holy war, baptised in fire and steel Holy war, for the end we bring is soon Holy war, now face the storm A holy war

Black dogs howl in the night
The lion, the lion is dead
A solitary messenger
The master of revenge
Full moon light's calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat  I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
And steel is on my side
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
I am an outcast on the path of no return

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline
Every light  I see is green
Open pipes
My machine's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now, you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, fast, fast, fast
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood's nitroglycerin,  I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me
To scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke, tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Manowar,  Manowar, living on the road When we're in town, speakers explode We don't attract wimps Cause we're too loud Just true metal people That's  Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills Other bands play,  Manowar kills
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps Man, they blast

Wearing jeans and leather
Not  Cracker  Jack clothes
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills Other bands play,  Manowar kills
Now listen to me
We are the kings of metal
Coming to town

That we'll ever turn down
They wanna keep us down But they can't last When we get up We're gonna kick your ass Gonna keep on burning We always will Other bands play,  Manowar kills We're the kings of metal Kick your ass Kick your ass Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass We're the kings of metal Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass We're the kings of metal Manowar kills Kick your ass Manowar kills We're the kings of metal Kick your ass Coming to town Manowar kills Coming to town, we're gonna Kick your ass Kings of metal Manowar kills Kick your ass
Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world
And take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where  I stand  I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
From a battle  I've come
To a battle  I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when  I die
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes, await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as  I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin,  I await thee
Your true son am  I
I hail you, now as  I die
I pledge you my sword
And to no man  I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
High and mighty alone, we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire, we ride
Providence brought us
The crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
See the white light, the light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Now, rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice
That speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Now, feel the white light, the light within
Yeah, it burns a fire
Drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Words of power calling to us all Holding us together While other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting Our kingdom has come Kingdom come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come
She is waiting to kiss my hand
But she will wait for my command
My chains and collar brought her to her knees
She now is free to please
Woman be my slave
That's your reason to live
Woman be my slave
The greatest gift  I can give
Woman be my slave
Before her surrender, she had no life
Now she's a slave, not a wife
Her only sorrow is for women who live with lies
She's taken off her disguise
Woman be my slave
Chained unto my bed
Woman be my slave
Begging to be fed
Your body belongs to me
Woman come here
Remove your garments
Kneel before me
Please me
Woman be my slave
Chained unto my bed
Woman be my slave
Begging to be fed
I want you now
Woman be my slave
Brothers,  I am calling From the valley of the kings With nothing to atone A dark march lies ahead Together we will ride like thunder from the sky May your sword stay wet Like a young girl in her prime Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting
Like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while  I live
Now as  I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Now, power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
My father was a wolf
I'm the kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
Now  I will bring salvation
Punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Rip their flesh, burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants, burn their homes
Kill till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Grandfather, tell me a story!
All right, go and get your storybook
No, no, not one of those, a real story!
A real story?
Yes, tell me about when you were a boy
Well, then,  I shall have to take you back with me
A long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day
As  I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sound of horses, and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on
And find the place of these sounds
And when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill
Before me the armies of the worlds standing, waiting
I thought to myself
For whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up
From the north there appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle ax
From the east came a third holding a spiked club
And finally from the west, a rider who wielded a great hammer of war
With them came their soldiers of death
Followed by an army of immortals
They were few in number
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them
That they would leave this day only in victory or death
And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound
Storm clouds filled the sky with darkness
Rain came and the four winds blew with such anger
That  I held fast to a tree
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air
Without warning, screaming their war cry
They led the attack, down to the battle they rode
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash!
I could feel the ground shake
The earth drank much blood that day
Each of the four, was unto himself
A whirlwind of doom!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead
There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield
Like brown leaves blown by the wind
And  I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill
While below them the soldiers of death assembled
All those who would now swear allegiance to them
And the four spoke the words
Of the warrior's prayer
Gods of war  I call you, my sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if  I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail, hail
And as  I stood and looked on
I heard the armies of the world hail them without end
And their voices of victory
Carried long and far throughout the land!
Well, that's it, did you like the story?
Yeah, it was great!
Oh good,  I'm glad, now off to bed with you
Grandfather?
Yes?
Who were those four men?
Who were they?
They were the metal kings!
Brothers, the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the battle hymns Into glory ride Hail to  England The sign of the hammer's our guide Forever we're fighting the world Side by side

( Prelude)
See my chariot, run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold, the wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The  Gods are my shield, my fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall, we are storming the wall
Stones fall like snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory in the fire of battle
Zeus, today is mine
Killing all in my way like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer,  I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me, let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye? This was your time, but the armor you wore was mine I will not rest until  Hector's blood is spilled His bones will all be broken, dragged across the field This, dear friend, is how we'll say goodbye Until we meet in the sky

Here inside the walls of  Troy, the  Gods weigh my fate
From this day do  I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
Many thousands  I did kill
No walls can contain the  Gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices,  I cannot hide The  Gods leave no choices, so we all must die Oh  Achilles, let thy arrows fly, into the wind Where eagles cross the sky Today my mortal blood will mix with sand It was foretold  I will die by thy hand Into  Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the  Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge and bringeth fury
Hector, feel my hate
A bloodbath  I was born to bring, by birth  I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and death
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire, death and hate Your body  I will desecrate Dogs and vultures eat your flesh The  Hall of  Hades waits Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
The  Gods who once protected him are now his  Gods of doom
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the  Gods give no protection
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the  Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate Your body  I will desecrate Dogs and vultures eat your flesh The  Hall of  Hades waits Die...

The oath of the  Gods, this day was fulfilled In the heat of the battle,  Hector was killed See him  Patroclus, down in the dust Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths have been killed
Cutting their throats, their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground Hector's body dragged three times around I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
Until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken, a promise fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed
Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of true metal
Proud and standing tall
We know the power within us
Has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal
There's magic in us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, go on, get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers,  I said leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone
We do just what we please
Got to make it louder
All men play on ten
If you're not into metal
You are not my friend
There's metal in the air tonight
Can you hear it call?
If you ain't got the balls to take it
You can leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Wimps and posers, leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all

Demon's blood and dragon's fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient  Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible,  I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that  I'm not there
With a spell  I send them
Crashing to the ground
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman
I make a secret sign
Now, welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman
A dragon  I must ride
The gates of  Hell are open, let me in
Rule in  Hell or serve in  Heaven
Choose an altar or a throne
All commandments and
Laws of man disown
Now, eat the fruit of knowledge
Unto no-one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient  Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible,  I move without a sound
They look, but cannot find me
They think that  I'm not there
With a spell  I send them
Crashing to the ground
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic  I am sworn
Hell is calling, we cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be re, die to be re
Die to be reborn
The trail of tears began for the  Cherokee
The white man came to trade and borrow
But then, they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers
Knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters, not the hunted
As the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals
We live among them free
Our trail of tears would end
One day at  Wounded  Knee
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
When we do the ghost dance
The 
buffalo
 will return
Paint ourselves for war
Now blood and fire burn
Great  Spirit, make us strong
Take us to the sky
The  Cherokee are brave
We are not afraid to die
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Red  Cloud,  Black  Hawk,  Sitting  Bull
Crazy  Horse,  Geronimo
Strong and brave, warriors to the grave
There has been much killing
There will be much more
The medicine man is dancing
He's calling us to war
Hatches sing with pride
Let the white man die
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
Great  Spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit  Horse, ride for me
We have come from the ashes
Of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire
On the altar of pain
Led into temptation
Now, the black  Gods align
Here, there is no salvation
And your blood is my wine
Here's a world that is waiting
Between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure
Are eternally wet
All is all for the taking, for a life or a lie
At the end of the breaking
I'll be watching you die
Crawl to the silence, renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers
Foretold of this time
To the words and the wisdom
To the promise of lies
By their anger and fury
The strong will survive
Lord of battle,  I pray on bended knees
Conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command
With flame and blood at hand
Glory and a broken sword
I'm the master of the world
I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone
With steel and stone
Eternal might,  I was born to wield
Let us drink to the battles
We've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc
We have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
Drink to the battles
We've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc
We have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south
In the black of night
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
The clash of honour calls
The clash of honour calls
I will stand when others fall
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
Open magic doors
They will know the power of my sword
There is blood on my hands
There is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice
I scream as you die
Thirsting of vengeance
And mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood
When your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven
Death is fulfilled
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
The clash of honour calls
To stand when others fall
Gods of war, feel
The power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
They will know the power of my sword
Black candles slowly burning
White fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations
Summon living fire
Darkest forces and your  Demons
Black order, black king
The cult that serves the living
Accept this offering
Black candles slowly burning
White fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations
Summon living fire
As the seven steps await
Hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure
The enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness
Of the molten seas of  Hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols
In evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your  Demons
Black order, black king
The cult that serves the living
Accept this offering
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts
Now, sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction
Behold the evil eye
And the  Demon's whip
Armies of the  Gods of  Hell
Ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction
Sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness
All born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil
Grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells
Death can live, when all life dies
Wage eternal war on  Heaven
Immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons
Are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant
One needs a greater sin
Night winds, oblivion
See my dark desire
Come forth and appear, he is living fire
Feel the  Demon's whip
Armies of the  Gods of  Hell
Ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction
Sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness
All born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil
Grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells
Death lives, when all life dies
Wage eternal war on  Heaven
Immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons
Are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant
One needs a greater sin
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
Feel the  Demon's whip,  Demon's whip
In the silence of the darkness
When all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream
Calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind
Hear the  Angels sing
Far beyond the sun
Across the western sky
Reach to the blackness
Find a silver line
In a voice  I whisper
A candle in the night
Will carry all our dreams
On a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky
The clouds will move aside
And there will be the road
To all our dreams
And for any day that stings Two better days it brings Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find
There, the road begins where another one will end
Here, the four winds know
Who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us
Now the time has come
When all is said and done
We're back together on the road
It's time to fly
No more time to wait
You know it feels so great
Wearing leather on a horse of steel
I ride
I ain't waiting to get old
I'm running hot,  I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me
I don't care
I got my wheels,  I got my friends
We're on the road again
We're all crazy
Gonna ride until we die
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down
It's just another day
I got no money or big house
Just got life
I don't like to save, it's more fun to spend
If you like metal, you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard
Well, that's my wife
Don't try to understand me
My family never will
Had to punch my teacher out
Now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way, it's my decision
One more beer and heavy metal
And  I'm just fine
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
We are the undefeated
We're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel
Let's drink to riding steel
Living hard and riding fast
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Time to burn
You losers better learn
No-one controls our goddamn lives
We'll do just what we feel
Riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest, so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal
Would we fall?
No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones
Into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together
Four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever
Till our kingdoms fall
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power, drink to the sound Thunder and metal are shaking the ground Drink to your brothers who are never to fall We are brothers of metal, here in the hall Our hearts are filled with metal And masters, we have none And we will die for metal Metal heals, my son
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power, drink to the sound Thunder and metal are shaking the ground Drink to your brothers who are never to fall We are brothers of metal, here in the hall

Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal, that's all that's real
In the beginning there was silence
And darkness, all across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burnt high in the sky
From down below, fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burnt
It's more than our religion
It's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal, we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
We believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
We're here tonight for heavy metal
Are you ready in the hall?
They have chosen us and
We have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal, one and all
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the  Gods who made metal
Are with us tonight
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna die
The  Gods made heavy metal
And they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than  Hell
We promised that we would

We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with
You know that it's a lie
The  Gods made heavy metal
And it's never gonna
Never gonna die
Never gonna die
No
Some want to think hope is lost
See me stand alone
I can't do what others may want
Then  I'll have no home
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry
To all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage
Ride into the night
Battles are fought by those
With the courage to believe
They are won by those
Who find the hearts
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul
Will point the way to victory
If there's a fight, then  I'll be there
I'll be there
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry
To all who hope to fly
Lift your wings up high, my friend
Fearless to the end
So for now, wave goodbye
And leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage
Ride into the night
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting is done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame
The time has come all training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting is done
We were born to win number 1

We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting is done
We were born to win number 1
I'm a stranger in town
And my gun's never cold
I'm gambler, so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead,  I won't step aside
Where trouble's waiting, well so am  I
I live for the fight, the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood  I spill
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast, live on the run
Stay alive, be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on  Boot  Hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
The law of the west was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast, live on the run
Stay alive, be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whiskey,  I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle, pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town, one more kill
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw ride
Into the west, a gun by your side
Hell and glory, honour and pride
A gun will decide
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind, hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing
About heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see
That a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight
Through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown, a ring
The power of the man
Who would be king
The power of the man
Who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind
Knows nothing's what it seems
The melting of the soul
The wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will
By destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear
Of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live
Like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power
To fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged
All across the land
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Time to face the world
Let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and
Keep the dream in sight
For those who never try
They are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind
That comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king
We fight to stay alive
By the power of the will
The spirit to survive
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
All of the dreams held deep inside
Have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing
Is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man
Who would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
For the glory of the king
We fight to stay alive, fight
By the power of the will
The spirit to survive, fight
Across the gates of  Heaven
Beyond the gates of  Hell, fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and lived to tell
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
To be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
Would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world
We fight for the king
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free
To die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave
Of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness
To see without my sight
Walk among the living
Free of wrong and right
The power of the magic
The power of the spell
Not to serve in  Heaven
But one day rule in  Hell
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
This power's greater
Than love and of hate
Is this the power of will and of fate?
The power to kill, the power to feel
The power of blood
The triumph of steel
Greater than the power
Of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy
To fight and be the winner
The power of the  Demons
Spirits  I command
Always by my side
To serve the master's plan
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
None can fight the power
None can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death
Are carried there within
Call out to the power
Of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth
Be lord of all the light
Kill all those who stand against you
Look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh
As they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves
Then cast the final spell
Fly into the night and
One day meet in  Hell
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power, power, power, power
Power
When they see us
They will run for their lives
To the end, they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Here once again
There's a battle to fight
Gather together
For the sound and the might
So long did we wait
Now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom
Fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood
That we gladly have shed
I now issue the call
Are you ready to fight?
Yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again
Tonight we will win
I can see by the look
That you have in your eyes
You came here for metal
To fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom
Fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood
That we gladly have shed
I now issue the call
Are you ready to fight?
Yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again
Tonight we will win

To fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel

Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Fight for the kingdom, bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers
Who stand before me
To no man shall  I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel
On my steel
There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it
If you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom
Many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will
Always live inside us
And now, it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
So ring out loud for all the world to hear
From the sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the year
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Now is the time
We all must stand together
So raise your hands
Show them we are strong
Side by side, the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
If you want to
Come along with me, my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Where the eagles fly
I will soon be there
Nessun dorma, nessun dorma . 
Tu pure, o  Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle
Che tremano d'amore
E di speranza
Ma il mio mistero e' chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun sapra', no, no
Sulla tua bocca lo diro'
Quando la luce splendera'
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera' il silenzio
Che ti fa mia
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero!
Vincero!
Vincero!
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle!
Tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero!
Vincero!
Vincero!

---  English translation ---
No one sleeps, no one sleeps
Even you,  Princess
In your cold room
Watch the stars
That tremble with love
And with hope
But my secret is hidden within me
My name no one shall know, no, no
On your mouth  I will speak it
When the light shines
And my kiss will dissolve the silence
That makes you mine
Vanish, o night!
Set, stars!
Set, stars!
At daybreak  I shall conquer!
I shall conquer!
I shall conquer!
I surrender my soul
Odin, hear my call
One day  I'll sit beside your throne
In  Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honour and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality, be mine
Call the witch to cast the ruins
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for  Heaven, not for  Hell
We are sons of  Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many  I'll send to the ground
Laughing as they die
We are sons of  Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Place my body on a ship
And burn it in the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkyries carry me
Take me to  Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of  Odin fight to die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars are guiding light
Oh,  I wish,  I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away  Dixie land
Oh,  I wish,  I was in  Dixie away, away
In  Dixie land  I'll take my stand
To live and die in  Dixie
Dixie land where  I was born
Early  Lord, one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away  Dixie land
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials  Lord, will soon be over
Glory, glory,  Hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on
Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right, to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the metal sky
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us
But they will never win
We said we would return
And here we are again!
To bring them all destruction
Suffering, and pain
We are the hammer of the  Gods
We are thunder, wind, and rain!
There they wait in fear
With swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king
First, one should be a man
I call about and charge them all
With a life that is a lie
And in their final hour
They shall confess before they die!
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
If  I should fall in battle
My brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse, and weapons
Tell my family how  I died
Until then  I will be strong
I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way, will die by steel!
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Hands of doom are reaching out
To crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain
No time to run within
And these hands you see before you
Will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil
Your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the pounding
And the army of the night
By the hammer of  Thor
You now shall die
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
We are high atop a mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now, the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside
You can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and
Tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain
Not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
We'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die
High atop the mountain
With hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike
Now, the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside
You can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and
Tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain
Not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
But we'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
They'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
Tonight we strike
There is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight
And some of us will die
But they'll always remember
That we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
They will die
They will die by my hand
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flames
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set,  I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back,  I never will return
Into the fire of  Hell  I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Army of the  Heavens, my army waits in  Hell
To battle on the earth for all the souls who fell
I will not go unto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until  I reach my home
Across the bridge of death
Beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness
Into the black of night
No road back,  I never will return
Into the fire of  Hell  I will burn and die
Die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Into the darkness  I command my soul
Never shall  I repent, never shall  I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath
My enemies all shall die
Die, die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Die, die, die, into the house of death
Die, die, die, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Into the fire, into the fire
Into the fire, into the fire of  Hell
Into the house, into the house
Into the house, into the house of death
Die, die, into the fire of  Hell
When they come,  I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the  Heavens are moving
Soon, they will align
Thor,  God of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal, together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Ride on from  Hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth where none shall remain
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Ride on from  Hell into the sky
We'll fight until, fight until, fight until we die
Sons of  Demons,  I command you to fly
Fight
From the darkness  I walk into the light
From the day  I walk into the night
From the shadows  I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart  I will be strong
To the defenders of faith  I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
From the darkness  I walk into the light
From the day  I walk into the night
From the shadows  I will appear
With a message for all who will hear
For the weak of heart  I will be strong
To the defenders of faith  I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine
All stand together for the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
Let's all stand together
For the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
Let's all stand together
For the world to see
Now, the time is right
To live out all our dreams
Say the words forever
Your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say
I believe
If you want to win tonight, say
I believe
Dreadful thunder, the storm's moving in
And judgement day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory
I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes, heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of battle
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I am the sole descendant
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage
By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the air and the water
By the fire and the land
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of death and destruction
To all that  I now kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of battle
I long to be free, so  I wait for a sign
I wait for a star to fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand that if  I fall
I will live again
I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves
I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring death and destruction
To all that  I will kill
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And  I will fight, yes,  I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Powers of the universe did sire a son
He was baptised by fire, water, earth and sky
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light
And he alone shall forever be known
As the king of kings
I enter this world
Born under a sign of infinite light
And here  I shall dwell
I now understand
All that  I am
Shall live in thy command
Voices of victory, all shout and proclaim
The kingdom of glory is mine
The raise of the will, our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of  Hell
My armies of fire await
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late
Crack the earth,  Gods of thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the fight,  I own the right
To be the king of kings
My enemies rise and look to the skies
They pray  I will never appear
Their life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the  Demons that live in the wind
As my chariot drives in the storm
With the hot blood of battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and  I'll die by the sword
All the days of his life he walked without fear
All whose lives he touched were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true his justice and retribution were unfailing
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and magic wind
The kingdom of the king
King of kings
King of kings
King of kings
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla
 waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
He is descended from giants
His father  Loki,  God of fire Is the sworn blood brother to  Odin himself
He rides across land, sea and air From the land of the living to the land of the dead
This eight-legged steed crosses eight points of the compass
From eight directions into eight dimensions
He is the bringer of the valiant dead
From the battlefield to  Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle Over land and sea Across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back  I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by  Valkyries, we valiant dead
To the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from  Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died, but never yielded
Faster than the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of  Asgard across the sky
To the world of  Gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war  God  Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Carry we who die in battle Over land and sea Across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
Odin's waiting
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men
As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of  Thor his friend
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To  Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
Brother to  Thor
And  Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns forever more
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To  Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
(repeat)
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show
And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do,  I am here for you
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain
A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like
You're reaching the end
Call on me, know with your heart
One who will always depend
I am thy friend
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens,  Huginn and  Muninn.  They circle the  Earth by day seeing all.  At night they report to him the world's tidings.  He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring.  At his side sit two wolves.  His weapons, a magic sword and a spear called  Gungnir.  They are carved with runes.  His eight legged horse  Sleipnir carries him over land sea and air.  The bringer of the valiant dead, the  Einherjar.  From the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to  Valhalla
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye.  He was granted supreme wisdom.  He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.  Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.  Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.  Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.  In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.  He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.  He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of  Odin!
Here to the blaze  I wander
Through this black night  I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords did clash
Fallen by our axes, helmets smashed
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too,  I may fall
I will enter  Odin's hall
I will die, sword in hand
My name and my deeds
Will scorch the land
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Sons of  Odin, we four
By the hammer of  Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born, another shall fall
This day men will die
Glory and fame, blood is our name
Souls full of thunder, hearts of steel
Killers of men, of warriors' friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Sons of the  Gods
Today, we shall die
Open  Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Let the battle begin
With swords in the wind
Hail  Gods of war
Onward into the heart of the battle fought the sons of  Odin
Outnumbered many times, still they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells that once were bodies
But  Odin alone would choose the day they would enter  Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them the berserker rage
Now  Gods of men, they rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals, such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon could harm them
They killed men and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail  Gods of war
Deep into the heart of the battle they fought
Covered on all sides as all converged on them
Until the four could no longer be seen
As time passed  I feared them lost
Then slowly the armies separated
Many were dead
I saw the four
Each down on one knee
All stopped to watch and gaze upon them with a smile of victory
Before sending them into the ground
Then they rose together
To make a final stand
With their last bit of strength
They raised their arms into the air
Pointing blood stained weapons to the sky
They called upon the god of war and made ready to die
But  Odin would not call them this day to  Valhalla
Instead he sent thunder and lightning
To strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the  Berserker rage!
Now filled with that strength
The power of a thousand men was given them
No longer mortal
They were touched by the gods
This time when they took up the attack
Men fell not by tens
But by hundreds
By thousands
And when the smoke did clear
The four spoke the words
And the masses answered the response of the warrior's prayer
Gods of  War  I call you,  Gods of  War  I call you
My sword is by my side,  My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor,  I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride,  Free from all false pride
I will crack the whip,  I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail,  With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death,  Cover me with death
If  I should ever fail,  If  I should ever fail
Glory,  Glory, majesty, majesty, unity, unity
Hail,  Hail!  Hail,  Hail!  Hail!
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee, raise thy hand
We, the sons of  Odin await thy command
Born under the sign of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die!
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound!
Let thy  Valkyries fly!!
Down from the sky into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Today is the day we  Die in the fight
None shall remain to pass one more night
Now  Valhalla's calling us immortal
We are gods immortal!
We are  Gods  Of  War!!
Odin!
Here the fallen waits
To join thee
By thy side
Let  Valhalla's gates
Open wide.....
Born under the sign of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died!
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound!!
Let thy  Valkyries fly!!!
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom bring an end to their story
Today is the day we  Die in the fight
None shall remain to pass one more night
Now  Valhalla's calling us immortal
We are gods immortal!
We are  Gods  Of  War!!
Down from the sky

Hearts full of rage, full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
In the halls of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Speared, hung upside down
Nine days and nights
No food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death  I am king
For both do  I bring
By sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die, let  Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at  Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits, so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
A hero was he, touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died a man of honour
He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal
Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand, rest thy command
For  Odin's call was heard
Above them all
Thy name shall never die
Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge, death's no stranger
Blood and death lived on his sword
The  God of war, his only lord
Into the depths of  Hell
Go all, he fell
Take thy shield, take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them
When  Odin bid thee rise
For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the  Valkyries fly
As so it was by the hand of  Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of  Valhalla and into legend
Rise, brother, rise, pass  Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now, the son of  Odin rise
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We will die
Quit my job this morning, said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause  I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So  I walked outside into the streets
From a hall  I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so  I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother, said
My friends are over there
They call themselves immortals They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said
Hold your head up high
Raise your fists up in the air
Play metal louder than  Hell, louder than  Hell
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We would die
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We will die
Brothers, stand beside me
There's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching
They're marching on me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
Louder than  Hell
They can't stop us
Let them try
For heavy metal
We would die
Riding on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sitting in leather, riding on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again
No, he won't
You were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
My social workers got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name
Yes, it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks run out next week
It won't be very long till  I'm back
On the streets again
Now, now you were sitting home
And  I got sent to ' Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone?
Hear me ride on into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes,  I am
I'm gonna ride on you, baby
By moonlight, we ride
Ten thousand side by side
With swords drawn, held high
Our whips and armor shine
Hail to thee, our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gone are the days, when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's wake
The sense of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh
Victory, victory, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
To the battle, we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space, no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men die
We crossed a starlit sky
And still, no space and time
We'll catch the wind
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh
Kill,  Kill, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


Faster than a bullet, terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger, he's half man and half machine
Rides the  Metal  Monster, breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
Planets devastated, mankind's on its knees A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas Through boiling clouds of thunder, blasting bolts of steel Evil's going under deadly wheels
He is the  Painkiller This is the  Painkiller Oh!
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture, stronger free and brave Nevermore encaptured, they've been brought back from the grave With mankind resurrected, forever to survive Returns from  Armageddon to the skies
He is the  Painkiller
This is the  Painkiller
Wings of steel  Painkiller

Soul  Stealers ripping out hearts

Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings

Wipes out in rage
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone  I walk through fire
Till  I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bulletproof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future Writings on the wall Legend in my lifetime Stories will recall
Leather rebel

Something's calling in the night
Electric madness roars in sight
Heat is rising, blazing fast
Hot and evil, feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Raging fury, wired for sound
Nitro bombshell shakes the ground
High and mighty rips the air
Piercing laser, burning glare
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Temperature is boiling, magnifying might
Feeding like a virus, flashing light
Imminent collision, shockwaves all around
Generating energy, screams so loud
It's coming, meltdown
Start running, countdown
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown

Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
" Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant As they hoped it would Souls ascend to heaven While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of  Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Night crawler Beware the beast in black Night crawler You know he's coming back Night crawler
He's going to get you
He's going to get you
Beware of the beast
Night crawler
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you
Night crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
He's going to get you


You mesmerize slowly Till  I can't believe my eyes Ecstasy controls me What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But  I still feed the flame
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But  I still feed the flame
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Arousing me now
With a sense of desire
Possessing my soul
Until my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
You're possessing me
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
In the night Come to me You know  I want your touch of evil In the night Please set me free I can't resist a touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch


Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember
One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire, one shot at glory
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death, we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember
One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire, one shot at glory
This day will last forever Deep in the hearts of men Courage and victory Remember, remember
One shot at glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
One shot at glory
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire, one shot at glory
I still hear the battle cry I still see the banners fly

Where would you be without music?
You would be nowhere at all
We wouldn't be here doing this now
If you weren't having a ball
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Not even the pink or white noise?
Well, thankfully we've got the license
To have us some fun with the boys
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way
The melody line's fascinating
The rhythm is something divine
It sends our adrenaline racing
To see you all moving so fine
One for the road
Sharing our load
Show us the way

Man-eating momma, steam-driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messing, all-in wrestling
Is one of her pride and joys
She's a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two-faced liar, full of fire
But  I know the flame is mine
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka  Rolla woman for a  Rocka  Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can

Got no silver for my pocket
Got no pillow for my head
And the winter it gets stronger
Got to ease my aching head
In the morning when  I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And  I wonder if  I'm dying
Or  I'll go out
Go out of my mind

I still get this, awful feeling
When the snow falls, to the ground
It still sends my, senses reeling
Telling winter, come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when  I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lying fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control  I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheating bitch here's what  I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy,  I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no  I've finished with you, your time is through
You are a cheater
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go
This could be our last show
Changing dreams changing schemes
Never
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should  I give sorrow, or turn around and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and  I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on
I can't go on
I,  I,  I,  I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open-minded, but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said  I was there
Lead to positions by stern-faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments  I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle, we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day
Is this the way that you get your fun
Slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob
You make me sick getting paid for murder
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds
Because you won't go to hell
Take your medal, wear it now with pride
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside


I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here  I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice  I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Now  I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over  Washington  Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause  I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes,  I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust
Diamonds, diamonds and rust

Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection
Takes another drink or two Things look better when she's through
Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new
Takes another drink or two Things look better when she's through
You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough,  I've had enough, good  God, pluck me
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine, she was mine
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Changes
Changes
Changes
Changes
Victim of changes
No, no, no
No

You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In  London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when  I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when  I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the  Ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if  I'm near
I'm sly and  I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for "the  Ripper"
Or if you like " Jack the  Knife"
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream at the sight
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the  Ripper
The  Ripper
The  Ripper

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds He could control our sense of time We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried Everyone was in peace of mind
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past Just seemed to vanish in thin air
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free
We are lost above
Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try


Behold 'tis  I the commander
Whose grip controls you all
Resist me not, surrender
I'll no compassion call
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Your very lives are held within my fingers
I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things who belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since  Tyrant was enthroned
I listen not to sympathy Whilst ruler of this land Withdraw your feeble aches and moans Or suffer smite from this my hand
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since  Tyrant was enthroned
My legions 
faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you
Shall scream as you are sought
( Tyrant)
Captor of humanity
( Tyrant)
Conqueror of all
( Tyrant)
Hideous  Destructor
( Tyrant)
Every man shall fall

Mercenary battalions
Are poised to strike us down
Terminations conquest
Upon us now full-grown
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Devastation hungers
She waits to leap to earth
Imminent liquidation
Before the grand rebirth
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Sin after sin  I have endured Yet the wounds  I bear are the wounds of love
Frantic mindless zombies
Grab at fleeting time
Lost in cold perplexion
Waiting for the sign
Generations tremble
Clinging face to face
Helpless situation
To end the perfect race
Flashing senseless sabres
Cut us to the ground
Eager for the lifeblood
Of all who can be found
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
Slice to the left, slice to the right
None to retaliate, none will fight
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives
This race departs, no one will survive
Heads to the feet, feet to the air
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair
End of all ends, body into dust
To greet death friends, extinction is a must

The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down
Every now and then he'll take a look around
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again
With trembling hands, he wipes a tear
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go
But spare a thought as you pass him by
Take a closer look and you'll say
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday
A lonely grave, and soon forgot
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear
For anyone who's passing near
It names the person lying here as you And you, and you, and you...

Beware of their coming
Take heed our time is near
Fatality relinquish not
Brutality in arms doth seek to destroy
They smashed through the clouds into the light of the moon
Their steeds were full charging, called destruction and doom
' Twas as if all hell had broke loose on this night
And all in all it was a terrible sight
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
We gotta get, we gotta get, we gotta get out of this place
There's a man with a needle who's pleading to get to my face
Hide me and hold me control free as best as you can
It's all becoming too much,  I can't cope, for one man
Now we are taken unto the island of domination
Skyrider, supersonic flyer
Nightdriver, the demon of desire
Spinesnapper, you tried your best to break us
Throatchoker, you thought that you could take us
The fright of your life, the fright of your life
The fright of your life is here guaranteed
This is no illusion confessing confusion you're freed
Lashings of strappings with beatings competing to win
Oh, what a mess  I am blessed, dominations set in
Now we are taken unto the island of domination

Sinner rider, rides in with the storm
The  Devil rides beside him
The  Devil is his god,  God help you mourn
Do you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder?
Deafen every living thing about
Can you, can you see it, can you?
See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising, time is running out
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner!  Sinner!
( Is this obligation?)
Sinner!  Sinner!
His steed of fury
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the carcasses of war
But if it's hungry, then its very presence
Disrupts the calm into the storm
Curse and damn you all, you'll fall by the hand of the
Sinner!  Sinner!
( Desegregation)
Sinner!  Sinner!
God of the devils, god of the devils
Won't you help them pray?
God of the devils, god of the devils
Is there no other way?
Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight?
Can't you see their blood is boiling, setting them alight?
Thirty years now sleeping, so sound
War raises its head and looks slowly around
The sinner is near, sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin' around
Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain?
Can't you hear their blood is boiling, setting them alight?
Sinner,  Sinner,  Sinner,  Sinner!
Sinner!  Sinner!
Sinner!  Sinner!
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Curse and damn you all, you fall by the hand of the
Sinner

Look out, here's  Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never seen again
Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker

Paradise is waiting
For the chosen few

Starbreaker
Takes you up so high
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker, breaker
Starbreaker

Throughout the soft and timeless days of  August
Till now the shadows begin to grow much longer
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
I give you this, the last rose of summer
A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
Till one day, not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose bud,  I shall return
A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
In your long shadows, the last rose of summer
In the sunset, the last rose of summer
Take this rose that  I give you
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
Don't worry about the winter, the last rose of summer
I shall return, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer...



I made a spike about nine o'clock on a  Saturday
All eyes hit me as  I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff,  New  York, fire island
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled " Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up,  I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that
I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours
Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess  I dream in pictures, not colours
The true free expression  I demand is human rights, right
I gave my life,  I am immortal
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming
Raw deal

Once  I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by,  I'm still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears
All alone, no one cares, so much to give to you all out there
Take me now, in your arms, let me rest, safe from harm
Oh,  I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me?
Here they come, here come the tears...

Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin
Exploding, reloading, this quest never-ending Until  I give out my last breath
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
I know what  I am,  I'm  Berlin

Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn Looking like a comet slicing through the morn Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches fries into a crisp Let him get close to you so you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smolder, blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter Here he comes now Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you see the light again
So much self-indulgence results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us with combustive dance
All shall bear the branding of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses melting into one
Only when there's order will his job be done
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Here he comes now
Bow to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land
Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter



You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why  I'm alive within
I can't find the words, my mind is dead
It's better by you, better than me
Guess you'll have to tell her how  I tried
To speak up thoughts  I've held so long inside
Tell her now  I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you, better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you, better than me You can tell what  I want it to be You can say what  I only can see It's better by you, better than me
Guess  I'll have to change my way of living
Don't want to really know the way  I feel
Guess  I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you, better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you, better than me You can say what  I only can see You can tell what  I want it to be It's better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can tell what  I want it to be ( Better than me)
You can say what  I only can see
Better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can say what  I only can see ( Better than me)
You can tell what  I want it, what  I want it, what  I want it to be

Wild-eyed and tight-fisted,  I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and  Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep
To infest and decay from the core
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean
Now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained class king
Stained class king

I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow
I saw a searing flash of light erupt and skyward go
I staggered back in dazed surprise
What was it  I had seen?
And as  I stood there mesmerized  I heard my spirit scream
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back
The call is out throughout the world
United we must stand
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
When they come to take control every man must play his role
They won't take our world away when the children we leave
Will have to believe in today
We warn you now you things out there
Whatever you may send
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by
Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh

They laughed at their gods
And fought them in vain
So he turned his back on them
And left them in pain
Now here come the saints
With their banners held high
Each one of them martyrs
Quite willing to die
Wake the dead, the saints are in  Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
Cover your fists
Razor your spears
It's been our possession
For 8,000 years
Fetch the scream eagles
Unleash the wild cats
Set loose the king cobras
And blood sucking bats
Wake the dead, the saints are in  Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
We are saints
In  Hell
We are saints
In  Hell
We're going down
Into the fire
We're going down
Into the fire
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
As carnage took toll for the bell
Abattoir, abattoir, mon  Dieu quelle horreur
For a time is was like second  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
The battle is over
The saints are alive
How can we all thank you
We felt so despised
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell
Saints in  Hell...

Who gives you the right to come here and tell me
I have to leave this place my home
To you it's a jungle, to me it's a kingdom
Where (my) people are free there to roam
Born with the stars we are happy and peaceful
Until now we were left undisturbed
But you rupture the forests our gardens
And fill them with filth from your cities unheard
Savage, who is savage Leave your morals, stake your claim Savage, you are savage Modern man can take the blame
You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man
Savage, who is savage Leave your morals, stake your claim Savage, you are savage Modern man can take the blame
You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man
Savage, savage
Savage, savage
Who's the savage
Modern man
Who's the savage
Modern man

He had enough, he couldn't take anymore He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried, they couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he'd sit there, stare blank into space No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled, it seemed as though with pride The wind kissed him goodbye, and then he died
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah!  I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But  I shall win
How many like him are there still?
But to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost?
Yeah,  I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life,  I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin It's not fit for living in
Beyond the realms of death

I heard a human voice who sang like no one else I heard a proud lady singing loud Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn But soon she found she was underground and wasted I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage Her body shook oh, she did her stuff She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much If you take the smooth you got to take the rough
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd I felt the sound shower around And he would take you with him where no music's been before As you merged the power surge together His music knew no limits if you were in its wake You had no choice, no, but hear its voice And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream But once so strong survive or become weak
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame But fast car users lose That legend's born from death and that is such a shame Because every year new ones appear
Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid

Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my body's aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton,  Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Ooh, delivering the goods
Shake down, rock them boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good
We're going to load you with our brand
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
Have it your way
Stealing your hearts
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Going to do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You got to learn your lesson
Because there ain't nobody here to defend your heart
Faster, higher, until it seems that we're going to break
Ohh, shooting further, giving more than you're ever going to take
Leaving your heads, crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods

When the day is over
I like to ease my mind
By juicing up my system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I smack a bottle open
I crank the  Hi- Fi high
I'm in a seventh heaven
Ooh,  I can touch the sky
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about my rock forever
It starts to moving to me
Just that  I can't explain
It's like a brilliant sunshine
After standing in the pouring rain
My skin begins to tingle
Ooh, right on down my back
It's really got me fevered
Pounding my senses flat
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about my rock forever
Rock, rock, rock forever
I love my
Rock, rock, rock forever
My fever
Rock, rock, rock forever
Always going to
Rock, rock, rock forever
I can't stop talking about rock
Now give them back, boys
So when you get those blue days
Here's just what to do
Switch into this lifeline
And feel it rushing through
Before you know it, blue days
Are better left behind
By juicing up your system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I'm in love, so in love
And  I can't stop talking about the
Rock forever, rock forever
I'm going to rock forever

I traveled to a distant shore
I felt  I had to go
An inner voice had called me there
But why  I did not know
I saw the evening star rise up
Shining out to sea
And now  I understand at last what it means
What it all means
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
I used to tempt fate
I couldn't see straight
I faltered through my younger days
Never knowing where  I was going
Then something helped me penetrate the haze
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Now  I am stronger
The haze no longer
Will veil my future destiny
Such inspirations and new sensations
Though nothing strange has changed in me
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
I'm home once more, much better for
The things that  I have found
Much wiser now, so simple how
Each time  I turn around
I see the evening star rise up
Shining out on me
And now  I understand at last what it means
What it all means
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright
Evening star  I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels!  A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams!  From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools!  Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams!  Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Got to leave your seat, got to get up upon your feet
Going to move you to the rhythm until you never can stop
We got the power, we got the music, and you bet you that we can use it
Going to take it rock-bottom, going to take it to the top
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Move a little nearer, you know you got to follow your leaders
Because we need you, like you need us for sure
We're going to drive you, we're going to ride you, we're going to get right inside you
And if you want to keep going, just shout out for more
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Sing your song, we'll listen to you
Sing your song, the spotlights on you
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So  I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So  I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking
We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up
You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
But  I'll make out easy because  I see straight through you
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
Because you'll get hungry in the heat of the night
And then we'll make love, just when it's right
And when we make love tonight
We'll be burning up
I know you feel the same
I know you feel the flame
Staring deep inside of you
Burning you up, breaking you down
Breaking you out in a cold sweat
And as you lose control, of your very soul
Your desire takes over
You'll feel the heat sway
You're round to my way
And suddenly you'll know that you're burning up
You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So  I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So  I'll play it dirty until your body is breaking
We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
Because we're burning up
We're burning up

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around Making me do things  I don't want to do
I can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things  I don't want to see
' Cause you're the  Green  Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night, dragging us up or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, then slip away, leaving me here
Trying to keep from following you

I never give true answers,  I never tell no lies I never walk a straight line, so never get surprised I don't ask no favors, so don't get abused
I learned to win when  I was young So  I'm never ever going to lose
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I never ask no questions,  I never speak my mind I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive I take care of business, it takes care of me
I look after myself and do it well Because somebody's always looking for me
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
What manner of man am  I?
A gun, lump sum and then  I move on
What manner of man are you?
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue
I do what  I do because  I can't do nothing better
You do what you do, just defending yourself Because you got nothing better to do
I got no face, no name,  I'm just a killing machine
I cut the population down, if you know what  I mean
I never stop in one place,  I move about the cities
Got expensive tastes, but  I hasten to add that I'm the best that there is
They pay me the money and  I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you

I move as fast as  I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a madman
My feet don't touch the ground
I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming
They know  I'm running wild
Dead or alive there's nothing
That bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall
They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and  I defy
Because what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild
No chains can hold me down
I always breakaway
I never hear society
Tell me what to do or say
I taste the life that pleases me
And raise a storm for all the world to see
I never stumble, never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but  I walk tall
And  I demand respect
I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Because when they see me coming
They know  I'm running wild
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
Get out of my way
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
You better believe it
Wild...

Before the dawn,  I hear you whisper In your sleep " Don't let the morning take him" Outside the birds begin to call As if to summon up my leaving
It's been a lifetime since  I found someone Since  I found someone who would stay I've waited too long, and now you're leaving Oh, please don't take it all away
It's been a lifetime since  I found someone Since  I found someone who would stay I've waited too long, and now you're leaving Oh, please don't take it all away
Before the dawn,  I hear you whisper
In your sleep " Don't let the morning take him"

We turn and face each other
My fingers pull your hair
You wince and jerk my wrist off
I bite my lip and stare
Your stance at once defiant
I'm rigid to your pose
You clench your teeth in anger
My loving swells and grows
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
You're dragged into my vision
Trapped serving to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout  I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion by
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
Going to take you
Want to get through
Going to make you
Do what  I want
You give me evil fantasies
I want to get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil and you can't hide
You're dragged into my vision
Trapped serving to my needs
Maybe your imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
Come on evil, yeah
You give me evil evil fantasies
Come on you evil and
Give me give me give me fantasies
I want to look at it those evil fantasies
If you need it  I want to give it
Give me, give me, give me fantasies
Come on and get it evil fantasies

Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn Looking like a comet slicing through the morn Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches fries into a crisp Let him get close to you so you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smolder, blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for  Exciter Salvation is his task Stand by for  Exciter Here he comes now Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you see the light again
So much self-indulgence results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us with combustive dance
All shall bear the branding of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses melting into one
Only when there's order will his job be done
Stand by for  Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for  Exciter
Here he comes now
Bow to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man?  Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land
Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter Stand by for  Exciter

There  I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as  I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if  I live or die
So  I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future,  I can't even start I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now, grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding, corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Cleaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off  I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal  Gods Metal  Gods
Metal  Gods Metal  Gods
Machines are taking all over With mankind in their command In time they'd like to discover How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why  I won't get caught
Refuse to bait the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
I've held my licence
It came with birth
For self-reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill,  I take my leave
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Look around
They're movin' in
Hold the ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
So give me hope
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try it
But they'll never get near
And they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
So give me hope
United, united, united we stand

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one  A. M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when  I make my moves right
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing,  I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when  I begin
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then  I'm gone,  I'm gone
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what  I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight,  I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time  I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance,  I'm going to take
Gonna kick out trouble and strife
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
No,  I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going  I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties, no compromise
Want to taste what it's like to be free
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
Alright,  I'll gather my things, go through the door
Live and let live from now on
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned
I got a will of my own
I go as  I please, fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When  I need it, then  I'll ask for advice
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise

From a fireball we came
Crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all
To make our own
Let us be left alone
Lay the tasks and pay the price
Everything suffice
Crushed and bolted all we craved
After every whim
What a state we're in
Is pain better than the grave?
Well, when we talk with other men
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger
In the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpetbaggers bluff and strike
Kiss of  Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Well,  I've said it before, and  I'll say it again
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel
It's easy to go along with the crowd
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
Oh, that's the way to find what you've been missing
So,  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
A chance before  I fall
You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice, it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your bidding
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go
If you get it wrong, at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together
And  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm going to do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
A chance before  I fall
On the highway, on the highway
Making a curve or taking the strain
On the decline, or out 
on the wane
Oh, everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend
Back on your feet to take the next bend
You'll weather every storm that's coming at you
And  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm going to do it my way
Take a chance before  I fall
Yes,  I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I got nothing to lose at all

Come on, come on now what you say
Somebody say you leave today
What's this thing you're doing to me
What's this fool you're trying to be
You're talking nothing but a load of guff
You're trying to put something in my lap, lap
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
I do,  I do anything for you
You make my stormy clouds blue
Inside out,  I'm upside down
Back to front,  I'm all around
Don't you leave me by myself
I don't like it
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away
Don't go, please don't leave me
Don't go in the morning
Don't go, please don't deceive me
Don't take it away

I've done my share of working out
I want to go someplace where  I can scream and shout
Show me the lights, where  I can find
The only thing  I need to give me peace of mind
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
Where is the spark that kicks the air?
Where is the energy that charges everywhere?
I see the crowd,  I hear the roar
I feel my body start to leave the ground and soar
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
I'm going out in search of the bright lights
Somehow  I feel that tonight is the right night
I'm almost there  I've got the vibration
It's coming strong from this generation
My blood is hot, from now on  I'm set free
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me
Because this is it and  I'm hot rockin'
Don't let it stop, don't let it end
Please let it carry on and on and on again
I get so high knocked off my feet, yeah
This is the only way  I want,  I want,  I want,  I want
I want to go,  I want to go,  I want to go, hot rockin'!
I want to go,  I want to go,  I wanna go!
Hot rockin'!
It's all  I want
It's all  I crave
I just want to go
Hot rockin'!

Change, change, it's all rearranging
Looking around at the, the situation
Go back, see what you're doing
The way you're taking life you're going to rack and ruin
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
Slow down, see where we're getting
The way things are going now
Your life, it ain't pleasing
Had my share of up and down
Don't spend time, don't spend time rushing around
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got something wrong to say
To say
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( Turning circles)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( So stay away)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
( Oh,  I got something more to say)
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh
Uh uh, uh uh

Full moon is rising The sky is black I heed your call  I'm coming back
The road is straight cast Wind's in my eyes The engine roars between my thighs
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but  I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
From desert plains  I bring you love
From desert plains  I bring you love

Golden halos radiating higher
Diamond visions softly breathing fire
Sky processions we are watching you arrive
Silver crystals arching beams below
White light spirals lifting up to go
Glass formations solar angels spread their wings
Spectral gliders drifting in the air
Wheels of wonder floating everywhere
Draped in rainbows gently we ascend

Say you want to rip it up
Paint the town red
Want to do the hot spots
Get it in the head
You drive me crazy
I know your game
You done it all before
You'll do it all again
You say yes,  I say no
My blood's on fire
I grit my teeth
You're nothing but a teaser
Give me some relief
I'm looking at the bottle
Sinking to the floor
I got to white knuckles
Can't take it anymore
What do you treat me so
What  I do,  I do for you

Alright baby
You know how to have a good time don't you?
It's the way you stand
You're always attracting attention
Now with your hands on your hips, and a
Snarl on your lips
Your eyes wore the look of danger
There's a lion in your heart
That's set to quick start
To a glance from any stranger
You give as good as you get
No one's beat you yet
You take the lead
You never need
You know all the moves you've got to make
You take it all, you take it all the way
You never do things by half
You're a man with a reputation
You never shy when the problems fly
You can cope with any situation
You take the wheel and crack the whip
You never slip
You rule the roost
You always boast
Yeah you're looking after number one

You've got it,  I want it
My little  Troubleshooter
I need it, you feed it
My hunger drives me to you
You bring me around with your velvet hands
You're getting new life to me
You put me back into promised land
Just where you know  I should be
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You're giving,  I'm getting
I'm getting satisfaction
You're making,  I'm taking
I want some heavy action
You're bending, but  I'm mending
Getting back together
You really got got got what it takes
To make a bad man better
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
Right down, right down, right down....
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You've got it,  I want it
My little  Troubleshooter
I need it, and you'll feed it
My hunger drives me to you
You're bending and  I'm a-mending
Getting back together
You really got got got what it takes
To make a bad man better
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down
You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down...

I'm rolling and riding away
Because  I'm a reeling and feeling okay
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on the run
I'm a rocking and selling my soul
Because  I'm living for rock and for roll
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on, yes,  I'm on the run
I'm shaking all day and all night
Yeah  I'm doing what  I know is right
Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
' Cause  I'm on, on the run
Yes,  I'm on, yes,  I'm on the run
' Cause  I'm on the run
Yes,  I'm on the run
On the run


Up here in space,  I’m looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you’ve private lives, 
think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape,  I’m watching all the time
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
Always in focus, 
you can’t feel my stare I zoom into you, but you don’t know  I’m there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There’s nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I’m made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I’m elected electric spy
I’m protected electric eye
I'm elected electric spy
I'm elected, protected, detective, electric eye

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowing  God of  Mars
Body burning bright
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screaming, demons yell
Bursting through the clouds
Well,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes,  I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind

I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me out of my mind
I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing its sense of all kind
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game that's being played
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals have been made
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone ( I can't take it)
Bloodstone ( You got me living on a)
Bloodstone ( I don't want that)
Bloodstone

I move away, it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like  I thought it would
Help me, begging you please You got the power, down on my knees Give me some kind of life Leave me be
Take these chains off Take them off from my heart Take these chains off Take them off from my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave I tried to run but  I'm tied to you like a slave
It's my fault loving you so You were so precious, how could  I know? You turned mean overnight Poor, poor me
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
I don't owe you anything Why don't you get out of my life?
Through it all the memories cling
And  I can't sleep at night
Help me,  I'm begging you please
You got the power, down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart

I want to tell you, hey  I think you ought to know
The way you're treating me,  I feel  I'll have to go
I've heard the rumors and it seems they're coming true
You do what suits you, but then that's nothing new
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How  I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that  I've cried
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messing round, practice what you preach
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way  I see it, oh, we're dead or we're alive
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How  I suffer for your love
And say what you want to say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that  I've cried
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what  I like

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind Fill your brain with orders and that's not right They're playing out a game that draws you closer Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear Always taking, baby, but that's okay What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me Told you once, you're never gonna win the race Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then  I tell you  I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Screaming, screaming vengeance
Screaming, vengeance, screaming


I'd spend my days alone,  I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there
Like  I was in a cell, a captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control
Down on the streets below, bright city lights would glow
The energy would rise
And through the heat,  I'd gaze, still counting empty days
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can  I break this spell?
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
Then one night as  I walked,  I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance, our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar
Oh, how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
So destiny has bought us oh, so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream, at last,  I'll be with you forever
And all at once, it feels so right
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
Fever, oh you set my soul on fire
Fever, filled me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night

Hypnotize me, mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip
Light my fire with cold desire
Losing all my grip
Eat my diamonds ( Eat my diamonds)
Drinking all my gin
Feast your eyes on ( Feast your eyes on)
A whole lot of sin
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
Took my dreams and now it's seems
You're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all  I had
Build my funeral pyre
Stop pretending ( Stop pretending)
Got me growing old
Your torment is ( Your torment is)
Fit to snap my soul
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
You took my heart and left it blown to smithereens
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh and drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed
Going under, hear the thunder
Death defying grace
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face
Vicious talking ( Vicious talking)
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised ( So abused)
I'm a human sacrifice
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe...
I can't stand it anymore

Fast and furious, we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate, whoever would contend its right
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane we're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane we're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free

You'll find there's life with victory, with victory on high
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning

Freewheel burning

Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
You gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying
We're going against the grain
So defiant
But they'll never put us down
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Tough as steel, stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer, yeah
Grab the lead in the race
No denying
We're going against the grain
So defiant
But they'll never put us down, spit it out!
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
No denying
We're going against the grain
Because it's so defiant
Everybody scream it again!
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night

Along deserted avenues, steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready, prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys, smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell, a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars, the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives
Now facing one another, the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the  Sentinel

When you feel safe, when you feel warm
That's when  I rise, that's when  I crawl
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room, where in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you  I creep
Then  I descend close to your lips
Across you  I bend, you smile as  I sip
Now you are mine, in my control
One taste of your life and  I own your soul
Softly you stir, gently you moan
Lust's in the air, wake as  I groan
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Invites you, invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you, delights you
It drains you to white
Love bites
You knew at first sight you'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite there'd be no turning back
So come in my arms,  I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites

Wrapped tight around me like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body as the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable, let rip
And eat me alive
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal, panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone and gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
I'm going to force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Eat me alive
Bound to deliver
 as 
you give and  I collect
Squealing impassioned as the 
rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum, spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Alive, alive, alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat

You can look to the left or look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes, he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights, flashing colors
Sleepless nights
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
They'll slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day, burning hell fire
You're blown away
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll Some heads are gonna roll
No, no
No, no
No, no
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no ( Heads are gonna roll)

In the last rays of the setting sun and the past days
Yeah, that's where our memories run
And all of those times still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and  I'll wait until summer, you never understood
That  I'll wait forever for love that's only good
As the light starts to dim, the fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Oh, no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh, no, say, it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh, can't you see my heart is broken in two?
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And  I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
When the night comes down
And  I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

I know you like it hot
I'd love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty,  I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside you
Until the power splits your head
We're going to rock you
Until your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with the iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
So come on, let's tell the world

We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith
We are defenders of the faith

Now let's see what you're made of
He is coming, you can't run
Violators that get caught
Will wish that they'd never been born
Exterminator
You are dead
Mutilate
Sharpened razor
Takes your head
Jugulator
Predit hater
You are trapped
Decimate
Desecrator
Your neck snapped
Jugulator
Jugulator, he is near
Attracted by the stench of fear
Part demonic, part machine
Hungry and it's time to feed
Iron claws, fangs of steel
Dripping from his tasty meal
Now it's time to jugulate
Feel your skull disintegrate
Jugulator, killing time now
Reaches in and rips your spine out
Violator
Big mistake
Mutilate
Vindicator
Rib cage break
Flesh and bones
Are massacred
Jugulator
Desecrator
Jugulator

Atrocities made every day
Religiously
Their sins, they hide
Can never disguise
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
They wage their wars
Such profiteers will nail us all
Their crimes concealed
Despicably reveal
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained lies
They fire at will, intent to kill
They have no conscience
They have no conscience
Ethnic cleansing, nothing more
Blood of nations, blood of war
Turn blind eyes from all your crimes
You bare our souls, show no remorse
You cannot wash the blood stains off
They turn their backs
While others commit grisly acts
We're scarred for life
By politicians' greedy
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained crimes
Blood stained lands
Blood stained minds
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
And while such predators
Stalk this earth
Disguised as saints, they kill our faith
Obsessed by greed
Lying through their teeth
They cannot wash the blood stains off

The hangman's noose won't get me
Gas chambers never stress me
They can line me up against the wall
No firing squad will make me
Confess or even break me
I'll stand alone or not at all
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will surrender
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
No shackles made will chain me
No endless pain will change me
The scars will testify this all
No solitary confinement
Will break my strong resignment
I'll die before  I will conform
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will surrender
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
Read in my obituary
Defiance breeds victory
No cage they make can hold me
No law enforced controls me
No trap that's sprung stops me for long
No prison cell contains me
No snare they set will claim me
Relentlessly  I'll fight them all
I will not obey
I will not betray
I will not give in
Not while  I'm living
No surrender
We never will be driven asunder
No surrender
We never will raise the white flag
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
We are all dead meat
Cut us, watch us bleed
Indoctrination
Will never suppress me
They're seriously mistaken
' Cause  I'll take them down with me
And just before they're finished
They'll scream along with me
We are all dead meat

Dead man walking
We've all been detained
For the crimes we've committed
They stayed execution
But we'll never get acquitted
Waiting for the day when they strap us in
When they pull the lever
Hear the goddamn screams
Shake with fear
Electric chair
We're all inside
Homicide related
They'll show no mercy
And we don't anticipate it
Move a little closer
Every day to meet our maker
They cover up our face
And then they close the circuit breaker
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh come on man
Give me a break
I made one mistake, that's all it takes
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh no, they're taking me slow
One way ticket to
Death row
So what's the matter, son
Too young to die
Take it like a man
Don't cry
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Say a prayer, best beware
It's not very nice
In the electric chair
Oh no,  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh no, they're taking me slow
One way ticket to
Death row

Your head, you will lose it
Severed when executed
You always thought
You'd never get caught
Decapitate
Sealing your fate
Rebels' futile efforts
Are quelled with effective measures
The sentence is read
Words that you dread
Decapitate
Walk through  Hell's gate
You've lost your head sir Well, you will tomorrow Sleep well
This court's best deterrent
To set new precedents
The verdict of course
Couldn't be worse
Decapitate
Example be made
Decapitate
Will seal your fate

Speak to me
Of those days  I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else  I can do
But one thing's certain
I'm coming back for you
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
It's time to burn in hell
Say my name
I can hear you whisper
Not to blame
You are going to blister
Scream in the night
I've been counting the days
And it's so amusing
To see you again
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Die, why?  Time to pay the price
Kill,  I will have my sacrifice
Plead with fear,  I am getting near
Friend, liar, time to eat some fire
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Have you got a gun?
Do you remember well
Who you used it on?
You're going to burn in hell
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're going to love me
Burn in hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in hell
You are going to blister
Burn in hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in hell, burn

Turn me off, pull the plug
Leave me with some dignity
I am not what  I was
And  I don't need the sympathy
Alive inside me
No one can hear me
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
Paralyzed in my shell
Enduring every endless day
Immobilized on my back
Aware of everything they say
Extricate me
Eliminate me
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
I can't blink my eye
Or cry or even speak
They crowd around my bed
Condescending words are said
Thinking  I don't hear or know
What is going on, hello
Can't you suckers hear my cries?
From inside  I'm still alive
It's my decision to abort
Turn off the goddamn life support
Let me pass from this world
Slowly fade away in peace
Comprehending
Unrelenting
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot
Brain dead,  I'm not
Brain dead, sentenced
Forgot

Abductors, they come at night
They come at night and they infiltrate you
They paralyze and they mentally rape you
Expressionless, they disintegrate you
The probe your soul and desecrate you
Abductors will bleed your mind
Abductors, cutting inside
They come for you in the night
They strap you as someone's slain before you
And powerless begin to explore you
You scream in pain but they just ignore you
The bring machines and they drill and bore you
Abductors, cutting inside
Abductors, drinking your mind
No one believes that you
Were chosen from few
Defiled and abused
By alien rituals
You wake in fright they are in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment
Abductors, will bleed your mind
Abductors, cutting inside
They come for you in the night
You wake in fright they are in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment
They send you back and disorientate you
A lesser race they discriminate you
Whatever said will incriminate you
No one believes
The skeptics laugh and annihilate you
They dig you out and excavate you
Authority and even  God forsakes you
No one believes
Hey, maybe  I am just a liar

Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the nights before
Dark eyes, scanning every vein
Exploding cannot stand the strain
Standing on trial, scrutinize me
Questionize my strong denial
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Windows, illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Free fall as  I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Changing my course blurred and scorched
Breathing exhausts we distort
By gravity of such  G-force
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Free fall never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within
Wanting much more implore you
Near to death's door to ignore
The screams of all
Who fall before
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet, bullet, bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, bullet, bullet

They have blown away the daylight hours we had
Left a legacy, a deadly aftermath
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands
As we spiral down into oblivion
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight
We shall never see another setting sun
Time to rise up and ascend, the end has come
No more willpower, choked by hellfire
Darkness above blackening out the sun
Gripped by steel claws Corrosion eating us
So before we're all devoured
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From up amongst the clouds
In cathedral spires
Jaws of corruption swallow us as one
Consuming every nation
Evoke resistance getting none
Complete disintegration, no good to defend
There can be but one outcome
We are no more ascend
Oh, we're so tired
Time to rise up and retire
In cathedral spires
Watching as the world expires
From up amongst the clouds
In cathedral, in cathedral spires

White bolts of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm
War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm
Forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain forever undying
Judas is rising
Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world ( Dark prince of the world)
Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved
The burden of shame
Echos the prophecy
Ascending from  Hell
Forever despising
Judas is rising
Apprentice revealed
Deceivers are crying
My crucified steel
Evangelizing
Judas is rising
Judas is rising

Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit
Down to holy  Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die
We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel
Rolling down the m-way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there
Until we all went broke
When we don the leather And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow Into one voice Took on all the world It had no choice
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel
We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind To be with our own kind
Got to deal with the  Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the  Devil
From a heart made of steel

If you think it's over Better think again There'll be no compromise
Time to hit the power Feel adrenaline Move into overdrive
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
If you think  I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Take it to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the revolution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution, yeah!
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution ( Get ready for the revolution)
Time for retribution ( Retribution)
Here comes the revolution ( Something's in the air)
Time for retribution ( Time to change, it's time to change)
( It's time to change, it's time to change)
Here comes the revolution ( It's time to change)
Time for retribution
( You better watch out tonight)
Here comes the revolution
( You better watch out tonight)
Time for retribution ( You better watch out tonight)
( You better watch out for the revolution)
( You better watch out for the revolution)
( Bring it down, bring it down)
( Bring it down, bring it down)

You said  I could never find a way to ease your mind
But where  I go you wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot
So  I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Desert heat can wear you down
But still  I'm rolling through
Did  I see your figure in the haze?
I am driven by your thirst
To quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price  I pay
So  I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
I'm beckoned by the glow
Of kerosene and tumbleweed
They're calling out, forevermore
Worth fighting for
I'm leading in the wind
Head bowed down from what  I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for
So  I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what  I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Worth fighting for

Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth
Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring
Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regaled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again
The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out!
Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's  Gideon's quest
To take  Satan's throne
The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverize all in its' wake
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
( Out, out, out, demons out)
Demons out!

Born on the other side
Of the track
Got to get out of here
I won't look back
Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive
Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire, let them roll
Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
Can tie me down
Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire
Forever
Wheels
Wheels of fire...

Angel, put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again
Oh angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began
And  I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free
Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun
When  I close my eyes,  I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
Angel shine your light on me
Angel we'll meet once more,  I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh, angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again

Here they come
These  Gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed
Speed of death
Cross fired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares
Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
All incensed
To overthrow
Strong defense
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fate's renowned
Put to rest
Abominations grow
Time to ram it down
Judgment for the tyrant
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and pain infernal
Honor bound your strength repleted
To no end they're undefeated
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You brought them through their despair
Hellrider,  Hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished
Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
Their valiants never yield
Triumph to the  Gods
Vanquished of enslavers
Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider,  Hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider!

And so now it comes to pass
By the eventide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class
For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the sentinel
So, it goes forevermore
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor

Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof
A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
Its leathered hide glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar
This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me
Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl
This highlands layer of mystery
Retains a lost worlds empathy
Resilient to discovery
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me
( This legend lives through centuries

Evoking history's memories

Your secret lies safe with me

This creature's peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep Lochness distress malingers what you keep Lochness protects monstrosity Lochness confess to me

With weapons drawn we claim the future
Invincible through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk till dawn
Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our union thrives, so go to  Hell
Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize
Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
Aim for the target
With laser red lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace
We fight with firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise

I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from  Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike ( Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike!

The devil's moved from  Georgia His mission's still the same
The world's become his oyster once again
If you don't think you're worthy
And you don't meet the cause
He knows what's going on behind closed doors
Beware there's voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
A master of deception
Who takes you by the hand
Then leads you to the palace of the damned
He pulls the strings inside you
And plays upon your fears
Your final scream is music to his ears
Beware there's voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
I'm caught up in this voodoo
Trying to break free
I feel  I'm being smothered
Trapped by this entity
Blackened clouds surround me
Filling me with dread
I can't escape the horror
With the devil in my head
He relishes the suffering
Can't stand this heart attack
My life's been taken hostage
And it's never coming back
Beware there's voodoo in the night
The devil's got you in his sight
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies

Like a cobra, they will strike
And like lions caged we'll fight
We were taken not by choice
They put anger in our voice
We were fearless but so afraid
Though in our hearts we still felt pain
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
Like a demon leads the youth
We are terrible in truth
No time to falter, no turning back
When we come under attack
There is no question as with a friend
We have our honour to defend
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
At war
We are together till the end
We have our honour to defend
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed
Never the heroes ( We were never the heroes)
We were made to fight ( We were made to fight)
Never the heroes, we were sacrificed at war

Born out of hell from the depths of  Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls
Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed, sorceries abound
Necromancer Death's his guiding light Necromancer Stealing afterlife
Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast
Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns
Portents of dread thrives on remains
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Raising the dead, cadaver consumed
Sacraments said, bodies exhumed
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing after life
Stealing after life
Death's his guiding light

Sun sets on the nations
World's in her disguise
Pray for all that matters
Saviour in my eyes
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Eden has been wasted
Deadly poison fills the air
Kneel down in forgiveness
While there's still time, if you care
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
I couldn't dream
To be without her kind
They wouldn't let her be
Or heal what she defiled
You are the hate that beats mankind
Torturous lies that lead the blind
Squandered the truth from all we said
You are the reason  I feel dead
Mountains start to crumble
Tumble in the sea
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one


Drawn from years of self denying
Lost in chaos before the storm
Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle
We can settle our old scores ( Our old scores)
Look to the stars and challenge all of  Heaven
Resist the  Devil, dare to dream
By grace of  God within our hearts eternal
For our salvation is for everyone
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
We'll face our foes so they can hear our voices
The land rejoices in empathy
This trial by fire will build from their attrition
It's ammunition for our enemies
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
Send in the valiant, fight for what you believe
Then we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We bring the lights
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins

Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's nothing left for you to prove
You get a chance then now's the time to move
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower
No remedy so be afraid
It's cutting deep just like the razor blade
No escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Rays of redemption
Fall from the sky
Into the maelstrom
Blink of an eye
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower
Immolate the bodies
No one will be saved
Consecrate with fire
Ashes fill the grave
Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's no escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower

In a league of his own
A villain with no morals
Above the law and reckless
Mutating day by day
Invisible and silence
Conspiring to get power
This man will stop at nothing
To always get his way
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
When you're mind in a vice
He twists and turns with terror
Keeps building up the pressure
Until you're feeling numb
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
The spectre creeps behind you
Shrouded by his stealth
Ignore him at your peril
He kills to heal himself
In the blink of an eye
He marks you with precision
Corrupting all he touches
Salvation in your soul
Scourging you in silence
As he makes his incision
The venom's taking over
This tyrant takes his toll
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
You'll be frozen in fright
Like the glint of his knife
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre

The river shows no mercy
The tower looms into my view
I sense my execution's closing
With darkness all around me
The axe is ground to end my days
The raven's cry proclaims repentance
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Into the storm
I'm gonna win
Killer of sin
Saved by the traitors gate
A man betrayed for treason
I only wanted what was right
To bring a purpose by rebellion
The storm is soon arriving
And rain will wash away my blood
This walk of death will bring survival
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Ready to die
Carry the day
Bury the lie
Tear down the traitors gate
Forgive me for my sins
I meant no harm to you
So let the axe man fall
To justify what  I begin
Where will you be tomorrow
Now they've removed this mortal coil
I hope and pray  I bring you freedom
For 
Honour,
  God and country
This world can be a better place
As  I ascend from my conviction
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
River of blood
Turning the tide
Cause of the flood
Destroying the traitors gate
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Losing my head
Blunt  of the axe
Alive when  I'm dead
Escape from the traitors gate

You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack  I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause there's no surrender
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
You know the way that  I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who  I am,  I'm just a non-stop fighter
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave
Chasing a dream as  I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
I'm chasing a dream as  I go higher
You know  I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

Hey,  I am the voice of your anger
Hey,  I am the voice of your pain
Hey,  I crave the feeling of danger
Hey,  I am the one with no name
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
They don't know the way that  I'm feeling
They don't know the depth of my rage
I am like the wolf that is prowling
Hey,  I won't be found in a cage
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Lone wolf is there to guide me
From death to life again

Now look and listen as you walk around
And you'll hear voices on the wind
Those lonely whispers from this hallowed ground
Just take your time as they begin
As the sun goes down
The silence is profound
For they gave so much
So we might go on and live
Laying peaceful they forgive
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
In fields of wonder where those swallows soar
Our hearts are weary as we pray
The grass is greener from the tears that fall
For you on this remembrance day
Your message has been heard
Words of wisdom have been shared
Their despair won't matter as they rise above
There is no end to love
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red
From this earth take wing
Shine down from the sky
We see you as you fly
In the sea of red
There are stories to be told
As the years go by
All the memories unfold
Bow your head
Sea of red
On the sea of red
Where the glory has no end
There's a place for us
As our lives begin again
Bow your head
Sea of red

Walking through the city Looking oh-so pretty I've just got to find my way See the ladies flashing All their legs and lashes I've just got to find my way
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes With it open wide What you seeing, girl? Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it Can't you believe your eyes? It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Walking through the city Looking oh-so pretty I've just got to find my way See the ladies flashing All their legs and lashes I've just got to find my way
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes With it open wide What you seeing, girl? Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it Can't you believe your eyes? It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the...  Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... sky!
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the... (fire!)
Okay!
Just sixteen, a pickup truck Out of money, out of luck I've got nowhere to call my own Hit the gas, and here  I go
I'm running free, yeah I'm running free I'm running free, yeah Oh,  I'm running free
I spent the night in an  L. A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild,  I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free, yeah I'm running free I'm running free, yeah Oh,  I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
I'm running free, yeah I'm running free I'm running free, yeah Oh,  I'm running free

Ow, ow!  Ow, ow!
Oh-woah, yeah!
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and  I know that you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now,  I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul And you know  I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Ooh
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the  Phantom of the  Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
The only place where you can dream Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here  I am,  I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh...
Stalks of light come from the ground
When  I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby...
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh...
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a fiver,  It's only for starters
And ten the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the  Harlot, let me see love
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well,  Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well,  Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well,  Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
' Cause you're making love all day
Aww, 'cause you're making...
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making...
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the  Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the  Harlot, take me to bed

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed Dominance and persecution My mother was a queen
, 
my dad  I've never seen I was never meant to be
And now  I spend my time looking all around For a man that's nowhere to be found Until  I find him,  I'm never gonna stop searching I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
' Cause  I'm a wrathchild
Yeah,  I'm a wrathchild
Well,  I'm a wrathchild

Or  I know  I'll just go crazy
But now  I spend my time looking all around For a man that's nowhere to be found, ugh Until  I find him,  I'm never gonna stop searching I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
' Cause  I'm a wrathchild
Well,  I'm a wrathchild
Yeah,  I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Yeah!
I remember it as plain as day Although it happened in the dark of the night I was strolling through the streets of  Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then  I heard a piercing scream
And  I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all  I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Someone call the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me I never done nothing at all But  I got some blood on my hands Because everyone's shouting at me I can't speak  French so  I couldn't explain And like a fool  I started running away
Murder in the  Rue  Morgue
Someone call the  Gendarmes
Murder in the  Rue  Morgue
Am  I ever gonna be free?
And now  I've gotta get away from the arms of the law All of  France is looking for me I've gotta find my way across the border for sure Down the south to  Italy
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm never coming home
Well,  I made it to the border at last But  I can't erase the scene from my mind Anytime somebody stares at me, well I just start running blind
Well,  I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
' Cause  I know  I show the signs of
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Running from the arms of the law
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Running from the  Gendarmes
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
Am  I ever gonna be free?
It took so long and  I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should  I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If  I could go to somebody for help To get me out of trouble for sure
But  I know that it's on my mind That my doctor said  I've done it before
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the  Rue  Morgue
I'm never going home
As  I lay here lying on my bed Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is,  I want to know
Please, won't you tell me?  It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away, yeah
But  I'm so tired of living I might as well end today

Oh, yeah!  Yeah!
Ow!  Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow!  Yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one,  I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
, ahahahahaha!
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how  I came to forsee, see, see, ahahaha!
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh  God help me what have  I done?! Ohh yeah,  I've done it again!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs Ooh look out,  I'm coming for you!
Hahahahahahaha!
O-oh!
Listen to me,  Lamia, listen to what  I've got to say I've got these feelings and they won't go away I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees Oh, help me,  Lamia, or  I'm sure  I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now  I know that  I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel  I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh,  Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia,  I've got this curse,  I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh...
Oh,  Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia,  I've got this curse,  I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh...
Thinking of an age old dream
Places  I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly Forever now  I can't think why My body tries to leave my soul Is it me,  I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness,  I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!

Drifting on
Yeah!
Longboats have been sighted And the evidence of war has begun
Many  Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields gleam in the sun
Call to arms, defend yourselves Get ready to stand and fight for your lives Judgement day has come around So be prepared, don't run, stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come, the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders pillaging Invaders looting
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand The  Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders fighting Invaders marauding
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground Severed limbs and fatal woundings, bloody corpses lay all around The smell of death and burning flesh, the battle-weary​ fight to the end
The  Saxons
 have been overpowered victims of the mighty  Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders raping Invaders plundering
He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, " Oblivion?  Well, it beckons us all"
Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned Children of the damned
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're children of the damned Your backs' against the wall You turn into the light You're burning in the night You're children of the damned Like candles, watch them burn Burning in the light You'll burn again tonight Children of the damned

If you're feeling down, depressed and lonely I know a place where we can go ( Go)22  Acacia  Avenue
Meet a lady that  I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
You might even get in free
So any time you're down the  East  End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness? Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't you know the risk of getting disease?
Some day when you've reached the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any more beautiful wares to show anymore
22, the  Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the  Avenue
The way you walk, it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22, the  Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good, don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you, don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you, stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me
Woe to you, o'er  Earth and  Sea For the  Devil sends the beast with wrath Because he knows the time is short Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast For it is a human number Its number is six hundred and sixty-six
I left alone, my mind was blank I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind What did  I see?  Can  I believe That what  I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what  I saw, in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black, was no use holding back Cos  I just had to see, was someone watching me? In the mist, dark figures move and twist Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun,  Satan's work is done
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on,  I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But  I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me
I'm coming back,  I will return And  I'll possess your body and  I'll make you burn I have the fire,  I have the force I have the power to make my evil take its course
White man came across the sea He brought us pain and misery He killed our tribes, he killed our creed He took our game for his own need We fought him hard, we fought him well Out on the plains we gave him hell But many came, too much for  Cree Oh, will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom, the stab in the back Women and children are cowards, attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes Hunting and killing's their game Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good  Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives Run to the hills, run for your lives
Shadows may hide you but also be your grave
You're running today, maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide?  How long till they come?
A rat in a trap, but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
In gangland, where the jail birds die

A contract to keep and it's service with a smile

Dead men tell no tales

Murder
Gangland, tell no tales
I'm waiting in my cold cell 
when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cos at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error? Hard to stop the surmounting terror Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that  I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when  I try to speak
Tears fall, but why am  I crying? After all,  I'm not afraid of dying
Don't  I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, " God be with you"
If there's a  God, why has  He let me go?
As  I walk, my life drifts before me
And though the end is near,  I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that  I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand Maybe then you'll begin to understand Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah, yeah, yeah Hallowed be thy name Yeah
Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who waste her life
War babies in the garden of  Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone Freezing up the fires Sunrise has gone Numbing our desires Sunrise has gone Sunrise has gone
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Sunrise has gone Freezing up the fires Sunrise has gone Numbing our desires
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
" Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun
It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still, they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian  Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare
O,  God of earth and altar Bow down and hear our cry Our earthly rulers falter Our people drift and die The walls of gold entomb us The swords of scorn divide Take not thy thunder from us Take away our pride
Just a babe in a black abyss No reason for a place like this The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go A clever path for the fools who know The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind, you'll see The venom tears my spine The eyes of the  Nile are opening, you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss As the eye of the sun rose on her lips Moonlight catches silver tears that  I cry
So we lay in a black embrace And the seed is sown in a holy place And  I watched and  I waited for the dawn, oh
The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the  Nile are opening, you'll see
Go!
Bind all of us together Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you, oh
It is you
As the sun breaks above the ground An old man stands on the hill As the ground warms to the first rays of light A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun, yeah
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears Looks the old man in the eye As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd" In the name of  God, my father,  I'll fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun
Yeah!
Fly, on your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly as high as the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly, touch the sun On your way, like an eagle Fly...
Fly as high as the sun
Yeah, another prophet of disaster Who says this ship is lost Another prophet of disaster Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions Afflicting us with fear Predicting war for millions In the hope that one appears

You'll take my life, but  I'll take yours too You'll fire your musket, but  I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke
 
and horse's breath
As  I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the  Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the  Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away We won't live to fight another day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a  Russian gets me in his sights He pulls the trigger and  I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as  I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as  I lay forgotten and alone Without a tear,  I draw my parting groan
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Take a look in the pool and what do you see? In the dark depths there, faces beckoning me Can't you see them?  It's plain for all to see They were there, oh  I know you don't believe me
Oh,  I've never felt so strange
But  I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think  I'm off of my head You don't say but it's in your eyes instead Hours  I spend out just gazing into that pool Something draws me there,  I don't know what to do
Oh, they drain my strength away
Oh, they're asking me to stay
Nightmares, spirits calling me
Nightmares, they won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away And  I feel that  I'm weaker every day Somehow  I know  I haven't long to go Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now,  I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares coming all the time
Nightmares will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and  I know what  I have to do I must take you down there to look at them too Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool Can't you see?  Not just me, they want you too
Oh, we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares, forever calling me Nightmares, now we rest in peace
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire And the wolves they howled into the night As they fought a vicious angry battle To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away That the flame of life had burnt and died Didn't know the sparks that made the fire Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts In the search to find another fire To regain the power of light and heat
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all across the land
Drawn by quest for fire
Discovery of man
You killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct,  Animal supreme
By 16, you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind You came at last - nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones Take you and your blade and break you both in two - Break you both in two
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal

He is the  King of all the land In the  Kingdom of the sands Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the  Fremen In a land amongst the stars Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a  King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet  Dune
Body water is your life And without it that you would die In the desert the planet  Dune, oh!
Without a still suit you would fry On the sands so hot and dry In a world called  Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice The sand riders and the mice That they call the ' Muad' Dib'
He is the  Kwizatz  Haderach He is born of  Caladan And will take the  Gom  Jabbar
He has the power to foresee Or to look into the past He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see, he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme True leader of men
And when the time
For judgment's at hand
Don't fret, he's strong
He'll make a stand
' Gainst evil and fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying Rolling, turning, diving, going in again Running, scrambling, flying Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly Fly to live
, 
aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away Roll over, spin round to come in behind them Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten  M E-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our  Spitfires to face them Heading straight for them  I press down my guns
Rolling, turning, diving Rolling, turning, diving, doing it again Rolling, turning, diving Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly Fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly Fly to live
, 
aces high!
Kill for gain, or shoot to maim But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout " Let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers"
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time  Belsen feast, yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
The killer's breed or the  Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night Midnight Midnight Midnight It's all night
As a young boy chasing dragons With your wooden sword so mighty You're  St.  George or you're  David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
He threw down a glove, you made the mistake Of picking it up, now you're gone The choosing of guns or fighting with swords The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for the pleasure Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for the pleasure Oh, oh, fight for the honour Fight for the splendour Fight for your life
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The  Angel of  Death hears your last breath Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour Fought for the splendour Fought for the pleasure Oh, oh, fought for the honour Fought for the splendour Fought to the death
Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and  I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
Questions are a burden And answers a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number,  I'm a name
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again, yeah
I'm back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village and  I'm back in the village and  I'm back in the village
Again
Into the  Abyss  I'll fall, 
the eye of  Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this  Temple
Enter the risen  Osiris, risen again
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
When  I was living this lie, fear was my game People would worship and fall Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and Red wine for the one to succeed me For  He is a man and a  God And  He will die too
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave
I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
Now  I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved - For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell I'll strike from the grave
Tell me why  I had to be a  Powerslave I don't wanna die,  I'm a god Why can't  I live on?
When the  Life  Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour I'm a  Slave to the  Power of  Death
Slave to the  Power of  Death... Slave to the  Power of  Death...
Hear the rime of the ancient  Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three Mesmerises one of the wedding guests Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by Caught by a spell and the  Mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow, fog flies on the  Albatross
Hailed in  God's name, hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the  Albatross follows on
The  Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done But when the fog clears, they justify him And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm
The  Albatross begins with its vengeance A terrible curse
, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the  Mariner About his neck, the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
" Day after day, day after day We stuck nor breath nor motion As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean Water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink"
" There," calls the  Mariner, " There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?"
See, onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two
Death and she  Life-in- Death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the  Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one They drop down dead, two hundred men She, she,  Life-in- Death She lets him live, her chosen one
" One after one by the star-dogged  Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And  I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one."
The curse, it lives on in their eyes The  Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he
And by the light of the  Moon
He prays for their beauty, not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The  Albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain!  Hahahaha!
Hear the groans of the long-dead seamen See them stir and they start to rise Bodies lifted by good spirits None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes
And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the  Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long-dead bodies
Form their own light and the  Mariner's left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The  Pilot's boat, his son, and the  Hermit Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
And the  Hermit shrieves the  Mariner of his sins
The  Mariner's bound to tell of his story To tell this tale wherever he goes To teach  God's word by his own example That we must love all things that  God made
And the  Wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on
I've been trying, trying so hard
I've been crying, crying in the dark
Don't forsake me, the time of mine is near
Don't ever break me and the world that brought me here
Sick and lonely, waiting for the dawn
Sick and lonely, wondering what to do
Can you hear me, when  I say to you
" You give me your hand,  I'll give mine to you"?
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight shows me
I will take ten steps to see
Forty leaves  I pay for freedom
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight calls you
Take a step and you will see
We all need a quick solution
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
Free!
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
When the king of twilight shows me
I will take ten steps to see
Forty leaves  I pay for freedom
For a chance to be free
For a chance to be free
If you had the time to lose An open mind and time to choose Would you care to take a look Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Can  I tempt you, come with me Be  Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If  I said  I'd take you there Would you go, would you be scared?
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me Safe as any soul can be Honestly, just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing You try to hide your deepest sins Of all the things that you've done wrong
And  I know where you belong
Time is always on my side Time is always on my side
Make you an offer you can't refuse You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds, oh
From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things  I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is?
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years Face up, make your stand And realize you're living in the golden years
Out in the street somebody's crying Out in the night the fires burn Maybe tonight somebody's crying Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere  I hear a voice that's calling Out in the dark there burns a dream You got to hope when you are falling To find the world that you have seen
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
It's madness The sun don't shine on the sea of madness There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness, when all you see
Can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go
Out in the night somebody's crying Out in the night the fires burn Maybe tonight somebody's crying Reached the point of no return
Oh, my eyes, they see but  I can't believe Oh, my heart is heavy As  I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove Fly so high on wings above When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow On towards the sea we go When all you do can only bring you sadness Out on the sea of madness
Of madness, of madness
Of madness, of madness
Of madness, of madness
Can't understand what is happening to me This isn't real, this is only a dream But  I never have felt No  I never have felt this way before I'm looking down on my body below I lie asleep in the midst of a dream Is it now could it be that the angel Of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone And it's my soul and  I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the  Earth below And  Hell itself is my only foe' Cause  I've no fear of dying I'll go when  I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays I see a tunnel,  I stand amazed At all of the people Standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness  I'll be led Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish  I knew this was only just a nightmare
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Take my hand,  I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand,  I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth,  I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
My body tingles,  I feel so strange
I feel so tired,  I feel so drained
And  I'm wondering if  I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or  Heaven or  Hell? Maybe  I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to  Earth So could this be the hour of my rebirth? Or have  I died or will  I wake from dreaming?
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait, heaven can wait Heaven can wait Heaven can wait 'til another day
Tough of the track with the wind And the rain that's beating down on your back Your heart's beating loud And goes on getting louder And goes on even more Till the sound is ringing in your head With every step you tread And every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop Gotta win, gotta run till you drop Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer You're over halfway there But the miles, they never seem to end As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere It seems so futile
Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes? You reach the final stretch Ideals are just a trace You feel like throwing the race It's all so futile
Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner Run, on and on Run, on and on The loneliness of the long distance runner
Was many years ago that  I left
Home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me
That all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day  I scan horizon, sea and sky My spirit wanders endlessly Until the day will dawn and friends From home discover why Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone And men again they came that way To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying Where it fell on that day Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
What became of the man that started All are gone and their souls departed Left me here in this place, so all alone
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
What became of the man that started All are gone and their souls departed Left me here in this place, so all alone
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land Land of ice and snow Trapped inside this prison...
When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
' Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment
In time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realize you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
' Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment
In time is surreal
' Cause you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
Feel like  I've been here before
" My son, ask for thyself another kingdom For that which  I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east In a part of ancient  Greece
In an ancient land called  Macedonia
Was born a son to  Philip of  Macedon The legend, his name was  Alexander
At the age of nineteen He became the  Macedon  King
And he swore to free all of  Asia  Minor
By the  Aegean  Sea in 334  B. C He utterly beat the armies of  Persia
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great Became a legend amongst mortal men
King  Darius the third Defeated fled  Persia
The  Scythians fell by the river  Jaxartes
Then  Egypt fell to the  Macedon  King as well
And he founded the city called  Alexandria
By the  Tigris river He met  King  Darius again And crushed him again in the battle of  Arbela
Entering  Babylon And  Susa, treasures he found Took  Persepolis, the capital of  Persia
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great Became a god amongst mortal men
A  Phrygian  King had bound a chariot yoke And  Alexander cut the ' Gordian knot' And legend said that who untied the knot He would become the master of  Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide The  Macedonian learned mind Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for  Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side Alexander's army line by line They wouldn't follow him to  India Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
Alexander the  Great His name struck fear into hearts of men Alexander the  Great
He died of fever in  Babylon

(" Don't think it's quite bloody funny at all!
Don't know why you're laughing about!")
Life in the city living in  L. A
Is a long way from  Huddersfield town
The back of the  Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him cwazy
Wugby and cwicket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says " Wodney come home"
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on  Hollywood  Hills
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own  Hot  Rod on wheels
(" No,  I'm not!")
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The  Nautilus rusts in the yard (*grunts*)
But for  Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in  L. A (*grunts*)
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills (*grunts*)
He's winning at poker and playing the  Joker
And he always cheats when he deals (" I don't!  No!")
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
Looks down on  Hollywood  Hills
The  Sheriff of  Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own  Hot  Rod on wheels
" Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is  Rodney.  I'm immensely strong
When  I were a lad,  I could lift up five
Navvies on an end of a shovel
The reason  I never took up martial arts is because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
That  I came into contact with it
I was phenomenally strong
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is  Huddersfield
That's why  I don't live there anymore
I live in  Los  Angeles
It's great!...  I think"
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born
(" Bloody well right!")
A bear with a sore head we don't mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
(" Bloody watch it!")
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast (*fart*)
Your problem  Rodney's  L. A

I don't...  I'm not in it for the money!
I like it here, the sun shines all night!"
*throwing up sounds* *fart* *mumbling*
It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word  I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away
You're fighting your friends
You're wearing everyone
But it never ends
You're wearing me out
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Don't get me wrong
You always apologise
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word  I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Reach out (reach out)
And let someone into your life
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to  Hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one The fallen angel watching you Babylon, the scarlet whore I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son Kill him now and save the young ones Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own,  Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones,  I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand As a suicide you shall be damned And if you try to save your soul I will torment you, you shall not grow old With every second and passing breath You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When  Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit You'll beg forgiveness and none  I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat To clothe you in the night A lucky escape for you, young man But  I see you damned in endless night
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child Moonchild, take my hand tonight
Infinite dreams,  I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat Scared to fall asleep again In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing,  I cannot move Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will  I transcend? Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think There's more to this,  I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that  I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would  I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me,  I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth Of what's out there to have the proof? And find out just which side you're on Where would you end? In  Heaven or in  Hell?
Help me Help me to find my true self without seeing the future Save me Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams, ow!
There's got to be just more to it than this Or tell me why do we exist I'd like to think that when  I die I'd get a chance, another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again and again
Can  I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if  I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know  I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man I said " Don't lie, don't say you don't know" I say " You'll pay for this mischief In this world or the next" Oh, and then he fixed me with a freezing glance And the hellfires raged in his eyes He said " You wanna know the truth son? Lord,  I'll tell you the truth Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see
" Listen to me," said the prophet
Can  I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball Can  I play with madness? There's no vision there at all Can  I play with madness? The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha)  He said: Can  I play with madness? He said you're blind, too blind to see Said you're too blind to see
Can  I play with madness?
Love is a razor and  I walked the line on that silver blade Slept in the dust with his daughter Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence And  I will pray for her,  I will call her name out loud I would bleed for her,  If  I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, 
the book of life opens before me
And  I will pray for you, some day  I may return Don't you cry for me, beyond is where  I learn
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil, the evil The evil that men do The evil, the evil The evil that men do
Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Oh
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Oh
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Oh, oh
Then they watch the progress he makes The  Good and the  Evil, which path will he take? Both of them trying to manipulate The use of his powers, before it's too late Oh
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Today is born the seventh one Born of woman, the seventh son And he in turn of a seventh son He has the power to heal He has the gift of the second sight He is the chosen one So it shall be written So it shall be done
Now that  I know that the right time has come My prediction will surely be true The impending disaster, it looms And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me? Is it so hard to understand? That  I am the real seventh son Your life or death on me depends
( Suffering and pain)  Impending disaster
( Souls crying)  The  Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
( Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits)
I'll take your life in my hands Your fate, your fortune's in my vision Heed what  I say and you'll see what will be Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel  I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that  I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future,  I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know  I'm the one who is cursed?
( Purgatory beckons)  Souls lost forever
( Life after death)  Or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
( Now  Lucifer laughs,  Hell awaits)
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late
Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now? Is this a vision or normality  I see before my eyes?
I wonder why,  I wonder how That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day I feel a strength an inner fire But  I'm scared  I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind See the truth and see your lies But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet 
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange That as soon as you're born you're dying
And be reborn again?
The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man My future it is revealed Time, it waits for no man My fate is sealed
If  I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets,  I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So  I think  I'll leave you With your bishops and your guilt So until the next time Have a good sin
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Seven deadly sins Seven ways to win Seven holy paths to hell Seven downward slopes Seven bloodied hopes Seven are your burning fires Seven your desires
At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit's lost
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but he doesn't care
Doesn't care if lives or if he dies
The general commanding
Defending what we feel
The troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If  God is in his heaven
How come there's no heaven here?
In  God's name, they used weapons
For the massacre
At a point below zero
The sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead beneath the sand
( Bruce) ' What the fuck is that?'

We all got to try the  Black  Bart blues
Black  Bart's truckin' ain't what it seems
Black  Bart's lookin'
Don't know where she's been
Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
We all got to try the  Black  Bart blues (' Well  I know she did')
Black  Bart tried most anything
Black  Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see
We all got to try the  Black  Bart blues
( Bruce) ' What did you do that for?'
( Nerd) ' I'm sorry,  I just...,  I guess  I'm not used to...
( Bruce) ' Shut up and get on with it will you'
Black  Bart's livin' across the ocean now
Black  Bart's lookin' to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer
You could dance around his pole in  May
That's a maypole
Black  Bart's coming
Now  Black  Bart's gone
Black  Bart did it so  I wrote this song
Whatever and however
In and out or several at a time ( Mmm yes!)

Tailgunner, you're a  Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a  Tailgunner
Believe in me and send no money I died on the cross, that ain't funny But my so-called friends they're making me a joke They missed out what  I said like  I never spoke
They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey
Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah Making holy smoke
Jimmy  Reptile and all his friends Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers,  Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
Till the  T V queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth,  I've lived in sin And  I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
Holy smoke, holy smoke There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke, smells good
They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When  Noah built his  Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a  Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail
Holy smoke, holy smoke Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke This is thirsty work making holy smoke. yeah Holy smoke
There are times when  I've wondered
And times when  I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when  I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would  I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah
When  I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me Just what my life means Walking a long road Never reaching the end
God, give me the answer to my life God, give me the answer to my dreams God, give me the answer to my prayers God, give me the answer to my being
Ah ha!
When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet One way ticket out of here
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
In the cities, in the streets There's a tension you can feel The breaking strain is fast approaching Guns and riots
The politicians gamble And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
Mmm, what ho!
Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive? And some of us are here just so that we'll die?
How come the bullet hits the other guy?
Do we have to try and reason why?
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day Or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the  Lord above Or the  Devil himself come to give you a shove?
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come, a  Hell to face mankind
Be it the  Devil or be it  Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know Not just one power runs the show
Now the contract's out They've put the word about I'm coming after you
It's not the money  I make It's the thrill of the chase And  I'm coming after you
I watch your every move Study the things you do And the pattern of your ways I watch the way you walk I hear your telephone talk I want to understand the way you think
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, better watch out Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin Better watch out, better watch out
Assassin, assassin Assassin, assassin
Ha!  Ha ha ha…
I'm in a cold, cold sweat I taste the smell of death I know the moment's getting closer And as you walk to the light I feel my hands go tight Excitement running though my veins
I've got you in my sights I've got you dead to rights The trigger's waiting for my finger I feel adrenaline rush It's just the final touch And you can kiss your ass goodbye
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause  I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Assassin
The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground
Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of  Hell and the  Devil don't care
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die
A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim, fool for the day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
The lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to  Davy  Jones
Every man for himself, you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
Ah, in two more weeks, dead like the rest
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep
Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
I got the keys to view at number twenty-two
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature?  What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
She's tied up, she can't come to the phone You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know  I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Oh yeah, yeah yeah
Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love,  I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I’ve got those…
Hooks in you
Mother  Russia,
 how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow From the trees the snowflakes drifting Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow
Mother  Russia,
 poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
Mother  Russia,
 dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past
Mother  Russia,
 dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?
Look inside your head and find, tell me now and it's all in your mind
Look inside your head and find a way deep inside and it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Revolution, air pollution,  Chairman  Mao  Tse  Tung is in your mind
" But he's dead pal...  He's not very well anyway..."
A new day breaking-people hating
Love's a dream and it's all in your mind
S O L O
Segregation, preservation, politicians all are in your mind
Pewter suta,  Karma  Sutra, even  Blanckenheimer's in your mind
Yes...
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that  I like about you, but  I like it a lot
Won't let me hold you, let me feel your loving charms
Communication  Breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane!
Hey, girl,  I got something  I think you ought to know
Hey, babe,  I wanna tell you that  I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, cause  I like your charms
Communication  Breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown, drive me insane!

The price he paid for money

One yawn ah, two yawn ah

Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, madman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie, bonne nuit
Remember that song called kill me
A lecture on political chicanary
Of peoples rape, recorded on tape
Brought shame to the presidency
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human rights
Remeber that song kill me
Once used by a man from  Gallilea
He had nothing to lose, he was  King of the  Jews
Secured his place in history
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un provocateur
The news is read, the poison's spread
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn off the light, and hold me tight
C'mon, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini, belle vie
Vick played his part, with all his heart
He wasn't prepared for the shock
When hollow lead bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rock
A new martyr for the book of rock
The book of rock
A new martyr for the book of
Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt Making you money From slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers Investing our lives In your schemes and your powers
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place
The serpent is crawling inside of your ear He says you must vote For what you want to hear Don't matter what's wrong As long as you're alright Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven
The thief's in your head
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in  Heaven

Be quick or be dead! Be quick!
She fell in love with his greasy machine She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the  Beast before But she left there wanting more, more, more
But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
" I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh
But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the  Devil's bend
The  Beast and  Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Yes ah, yeah like ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr.  Murray
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity Hell ain't a bad place Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity
" Get on your  M11, get on your bike!" Ha ha ha ha ha!
Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow But it's not the fear Cause  I'd rather go now Trying to visualize The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground
When it comes to the time Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time We'll be ready to die
God, let us go now And finish what's to be done Thy  Kingdom come Thy shall be done on  Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves The reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?
But how can we let them go on this way? The reign of terror, corruption must end And we know deep down There's no other way No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

We live our lives in fever
In a choking sweat of fear
In the heat of the night
You can feel so much
In the heat of the night
I scream " Don't touch!"
I remember a time
When we used and abused
We fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time
We thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night, bodies aflame
We live in fever
I hear your secret heartbeat
I can hear your silent cries
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares
Till somebody famous dies
I remember a time
When we used and abused
And we fought all our battles in vain
I remember a time
We thought that passion was free
In the heat of the night, bodies aflame
We live in fever
We live in fever
Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key
To what you want to be
You don't get a say
The majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
Till the day you die
Hahahahaha!
I hear your silent heartbeat
I hear your silent cries
Oh your just in lies and lies
The kids have lost their freedom
And nobody cares
Till somebody famous dies
Keep telling lies and lies and lies...
A A A E E E E
-hahaha
I remember the time
When we used and abused
Ah, it was just lies
I remember the time
We thought that passion was free
And it was just lies and lies and lies...
Heat of the night
A A A A E E E E E E
We live in fever, we live in fever
We live in fever
Now we live in a world of uncertainty
Fear is the key
To what you want to be
You don't get a say
The majority gets its way
You're outnumbered by the bastards
Till the day you die
Maybe one day  I'll be an honest man Up 'til now  I'm doing the best  I can Long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset Sunrise to sunset
Dream on brothers, while you can Dream on sisters,  I hope you find the one All of our lives, covered up quickly By the tides of time
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Dream on brothers, while you can
Dream on sisters,  I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
Sands are flowing and the lines Are in your hand
In your eyes  I see the hunger and the
Desperate cry that tears the night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
Spend your days full of emptiness Spend your years full of loneliness Wasting love in a desperate caress Rolling shadows of night
On a cold  October morning As frost lay on the ground Waiting to make my move I made no sound Waiting for the mist To cover all around I carefully picked my time Then took the wall
I'm sick and tired of running The hunger and the pain A stop to look about Then off again
Being at the wrong place And at the wrong time Suspected of a hit That was my crime
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
Always looking 'round me
Forever looking back
I'll always be a target for attack
Ever moving  onwards Always on the run Waiting for the sight of a loaded gun
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
Even if  I find them And get to clear my name I know that things can never be the same
But if  I ever prove
My innocence someday
I've got to get them all to make them pay
I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name I am a fugitive Being hunted down like game I am a fugitive But  I've got to clear my name
There's a madman in the corner of your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street with you and  I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery, yeah
He's got your chains of misery
There's a prophet in the gutter in the street
He says you're damned and you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He's felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
It's only love that holds the key
To your heart
It's only love
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned your key
He holds your chains of misery
Now  I'm here, can you see me?
' Cause  I'm out on my own
When the room goes cold
Tell me you can feel me, 'cause  I'm here
Here  I am, can you see me?
Passing through, on my way
To a place  I'd been to
Only in my dreams before
In a world of delusion
Never turn your back on a friend
' Cause you can count your real true friends on one hand
Through life
There are those that deceive you
There are those that'll let you down
Is there someone out there that would die for you?
Thought not
Live your life with a passion
Everything you do, do well
You only get out of life what you put in
So they say
In a world of confusion
People never say what they mean
If you want a straight answer
Go look for one, right now
In a rooms full of strangers
Do you stand with your back to the wall?
Do you sometimes feel like you're on the outside
Looking in?
You can make your own luck
You create your destiny
I believe you have the power if you want to
It's true
You can do what you want to
If you try a little bit harder
A little bit of faith goes a long way
It does
Are we here for a reason?
I'd like to know just what you think
It would be nice to know what happened
When we die, wouldn't it?
There are some who're wise
There are some who are born naïve
I believe that there are some
That must have lived before, don't you?
As for me, well,  I'm thinking
You gotta keep an open mind
But  I hope that my life's not
An open and shut case
Extra sensory perception
Life after death, telepathy
Can the soul live on
And travel through space and time?
You know  I feel so elated
' Cause  I'm about to find it out
And when  I know all the answers
Maybe then  I'll come back
To fill you in
You, don't be alarmed now
If  I try to contact you
If things go missing or get moved around
It's me
And don't disbelieve it
No matter what your friends might say
We'll meet up again some place some way
One day
Lights out, we live in a world of darkness No doubt, everything's up for sale We sleep, all of the world is burning We pray to  God for a better deal
Nothing is sacred Back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?  Can  I go now?
Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide
Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory Come home, meat in a plastic sack
Fall down, pray to your  God for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean
Nothing's sacred Back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?  Is that it now?
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams
Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide Judas, my guide Whispers in the night Judas, my guide
The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool Who are you kidding being that cool?
Trying to break away from running with the pack But they ain't listening so you've gotta go back
You're a weekend warrior When you're one of the crowd But it's over Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now
You're not so brave the way you behave It makes you sick, gotta get out quick It's all bravado when you're out with your mates It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins The adrenalin's high Feel the tension Maybe someone will die
Someone will die
Someone will die
Maybe someone will die
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't that way anymore
You've gotta get out, gotta get away
But you're in with a clique it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why
It's hard to say why you got involved Just wanting to be part Just wanting to belong
To belong
To belong
To belong, yeah
A weekend warrior lately A weekend warrior sometimes A weekend warrior maybe, you ain't that way anymore
A weekend warrior lately
A weekend warrior sometimes

On  Monday
A weekend warrior lately

A weekend warrior 
maybe, you were never like that at all
I am a man who walks alone And when  I'm walking a dark road At night or strolling through the park When the light begins to change I sometimes feel a little strange A little anxious when it's dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared
To take a look, at the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you ever been alone at night Thought you heard footsteps behind And turned around and no-one's there? And as you quicken up your pace You find it hard to look again Because you're sure there's someone there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have constant fear That something's always near Fear of the dark, fear of the dark I have a phobia that someone's always there
When  I'm walking a dark road I am a man who walks alone
Vic  Vella:
...well
Steve:
Oh yeah?
Vic:
Went down ten feet, got a  J C B from the road, yeah, 'cause my other one wouldn't reach.  Dug it out... after ten or fifteen minutes he went back to the hole to check the height... full of water!  Must have come from the river, eh?
Steve:
Dunno...someone must have pissed in it
Vic:
Say well, fucking big piss... somebody did
Someone:
Something you were doing down the
Vic:
Trying to feed it through the ground, it's like a well.  About three feet deep  So  I....that's right, fucking  John shit himself.  There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, int' he.  He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and  I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself.  He was just going by the at the end of the boots.  He said " I'm fucking going,  I'm going!  Just lower the fucking forklift quick!"  And he grabbed hold of it, so  I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it.  Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!
Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local  M P
He's a  Maltese man and he's mowing the lawn my way
Roll over  Vic  Vella, give me more bales of hay
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella, don't you mow that lawn my way
Early in the morning  I'm giving you a warning
Don't you step on my tractor blades
Hey devil, devil he's on the fiddle
And he ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over  Vic  Vella, tell the tax man the bad news
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella, don't you tell the tax man the news
You want to buy a truck and need a new  V C R
Vic he gonna say he knows where they are
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  I see that panda-car
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella, don't you play those games with me
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella, don't you play those games with me
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella,  Roll over  Vic  Vella
Roll over  Vic  Vella, don't you play that game with me
Settle down!
She's got legs like an airship
She's got an arse like coal tip
She's got tits just like hot air balloons - and  I mean the  Hindenburg!
She's the biggest girl,  I'm gonna get there soon
Yeah, you know what  I mean
She's got love when you want it
But she never lets go when you get it
You disappear inside, you're never seen again... lost forever
She's the biggest girl of all but  I'm gonna get there soon
Alright, here we go...
Should be some kind of guitar solo here...
Well  I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
I don't think she was available, she was made a conference stall
I met her in a bar, she was, she was propping up the wall
In fact she was nailed to it
I gotta admit (?) babe... let's get down to it baby!
She had a brain like a sheep-dip
She got love like a cesspit on your mind
She was a big girl, she was big
And  I mean she was big, she was fucking huge!
Enormous!
You could have sailed the  Hindenburg through her legs and never even have landing permission!
One more!
Oh we sailed across the ocean you and me
I looked like a flea on the back of a sperm whale
Oh yeah,  I was waving a match inside the  Albert  Hall!
Eleven saintly shrouded men Silhouettes stand against the sky One in front with a cross held high Come to wash my sins away
Standing alone in the wind and rain Feeling the fear that is growing Sensing the change in the tide again Brought by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming
Why then is  God still protecting me
Even when  I don't deserve it?
Though  I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance
Why am  I meant to face this alone? Asking the question time and again Praying to  God won't keep me alive Inside my head, feel the fear start to rise
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes There'll be penance to pay when it's  Judgment  Day And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away
The sign of the cross The name of the rose
A fire in the sky The sign of the cross
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my  God'll lay my soul to rest
The sign of the cross The name of the rose
A fire in the sky The sign of the cross
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
The sign of the cross
Lost the love of heaven above Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away
I don't care for this world anymore
I just want to live my own fantasy
Fate has brought us to these shores
What was meant to be is now happening
I've found that  I like this living in danger
Living on edge it feels, it makes us feel as one
Who cares now what's right or wrong It's reality
Killing so we survive
Wherever we may roam
Wherever we may hide We've got to get away
I don't want existence to end
We must prepare ourselves for the elements
I just want to feel like we're strong
We don't need a code of morality
I like all the mixed emotion and anger
It brings out the animal the power you can feel
And feeling so high with this much adrenalin
Excited but scary to believe what we've become
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
Saints and sinners Something within us We are lord of the flies Saints and sinners Something willing us To be lord of the flies
The freeway is jammed, and it's backed up for miles The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be What we deserve we just don't get, you see
A briefcase, a lunch, and a man on the edge
Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven?  Are they looking down?
' Cause nothing is fair, just you look around
Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down
He's sick of waiting, of lying like this
There's a hole in the sky for the angels to kiss
Branded a leper because you don't fit
In the land of the free, you just live by your wits
Once, he built missiles, a nation's defence
Now he can't even give birthday presents
Across the city, he leaves in his wake A glimpse of the future: a cannibal state
Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down Falling down
The freeway is jammed, and it's backed up for miles The car is an oven and baking is wild
Nothing is ever the way it should be What we deserve we just don't get, you see

Each step gets closer to losing his head
Is someone in heaven?  Are they looking down?

After the war and now That they've sent us homeward I can't help but feel that  I'm on my own
No one can see just what this conflict Has done to the minds of the men Who are on their way home
I'm scarred for life
But it's not my flesh that's wounded
So how can  I face the torment alone?
The vivid scenes
And all the recurring nightmares
I lay there and sweat until it gets light
People say, " Don't worry"
Say that time's a perfect healer
That the nightmares, they will come to pass
Can't hear what they're saying
I am living in my own world
And  I'm feeling trancelike all the time
I hear voices in my head
Could  I really be going crazy?
In the night, the visions seem so real
Do you care if you live or die?
When you laugh, are you really crying?
You're not sure what's real anymore
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war
Fortunes of war, no pain anymore

Sometimes,  I wake I feel that my spirit's broken I wonder if  I've the strength... carry on Carry on
All my dark dreams drift like smoke in the breeze
The fear grips me as  I fall towards my sleep
Here comes the nightmare that never ends
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
In the house of my soul
In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears  I never faced
Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fears within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time,  I won't wake
Weakness  I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell
It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To shadows of the past
Take a breath and  I scream, " Attack"
Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Here is the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Oh, oh
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Silently to silence fall
In the fields of futile war
Toys of death are spitting lead
Where boys that were our soldiers bled
Warhorse and war machine
Curse the name of liberty
Marching on as if they should
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
Once, a ploughman hitched his team
Here, he sowed his little dream
Now bodies, arms, and legs are strewn
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom
Each moment's like a year
I've nothing left inside for tears
Comrades, dead or dying, lie
I'm left alone asking why
In the mud and rain
What are we fighting for?
Is it worth the pain?
Is it worth dying for?
Who will take the blame?
Why did they make a war?
Questions that come again
Should we be fighting at all?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Lord, is it over when the battles are done?
After the war and no one has won
I'm just a soldier
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
After the war
Left feeling no one has won
After the war
What does a soldier become?
Oh...
A lonely cry for help preaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to  God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when  I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life
You're searching in the dark Clutching at straws to find a way You take the  Tarot cards and throw them to the wind
You question your beliefs, your inner thoughts Your whole existence And if there is a  God, then answer if you will And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place Tell me if  I'll ever rest in peace
If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave it all the same?
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all?
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done?
Are there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong?
All of my life,  I have believed Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me All of my life,  I have believed Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah!
All of my life now,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven awaits for me
All of my life now,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven awaits for me
Yeah!
All of my life,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life,  I have believed
Judgement of  Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah
Yeah!
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
For a week,  I have been waiting Still,  I am only in  Saigon The walls move in a little closer I feel the jungle call me on
Every minute,  I get weaker While, in the jungle, they grow strong What  I wanted was a mission And for my sins, they gave me one They brought it up just like room service' Cause everyone gets what they want And when that mission was all over I'd never want another one
Oh, oh
I know,  Captain, that you've done this work before We've got a problem, you can help us all,  I'm sure The colonel's gone rogue and his methods are unsound You'll take a  P B R upriver, track him down
There's a conflict in every human heart And the temptation is to take it all too far In this war, things get so confused But there are some things which cannot be excused
He's acting like a  God—an insane lunatic
Your mission—
terminate with extreme prejudice
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow
Here is the file and it's all you need to know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Here  I am, the knife in my hand And now  I understand why the genius must die Now  I stand alone in the darkness With his blood upon my hands Where sat the warrior, the poet Now lie the fragments of a man
I've looked into the heart of darkness
Where the blood-red journey ends
When you've faced the heart of darkness
Even your soul begins to bend
I've looked into the heart of darkness
When you start to take a look within
Do you feel at ease with what you see?
Do you think you can have peace of mind
And have self-belief or be satisfied?
Do you think you even like yourself
Or really think you could be someone else?
Is there something that you'd rather be?
Never thought you'd be, had the chance to see
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
Feel the paranoia creeping in
Like a cancer eating at the skin
Do you feel you've lost your self-esteem
And your self-respect, what can you expect?
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
Are you scared to look inside your mind?
Are you worried just at what you'll find?
Do you really want to face the truth?
Does it matter now, what have you got to lose?
Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think?
Are you strong enough to release the guilt?
All my life,  I've run away
All my life,  I've tried to hide away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
All my life...  I've run astray
Let my faith... slip away
All my life...  I've run astray
Allowed my faith... to drift away
Have you heard on the news?
Another let-off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the bad man?
What's the matter these days?
No one has the courage to put them away
Nobody has any faith
' Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
When  I remember back the memories of yesterday
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses doors were open
No had to care; those days are gone
Those days are gone
Those days are gone
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care
It must be the cynic in me
But  I don't really like things now
The violence, the attitudes
Aggression that you see every day
A sick society looks the other way
Yeah
There are no marks upon a man
That can say he's good or bad
No label and no telltale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
When you look into their eyes
You don't know what they hide
No label and no telltale sign
That can show he's full of lies
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
" Ignorance is bliss," is that the reason
We cannot read another's mind?
If we knew what thoughts were dancing
Through each other's heads
Would we all be driven mad?
Would we all be dead?
By your deeds, you will be known
Time will tell, truth will show
As we exhale every breath
We all get closer to our death
What will you say
What will you say
On  Judgement  Day
On  Judgement  Day
Sometimes when  I feel the anger
Sometimes when  I'm all alone
Sometimes when  I feel surrounded
Like all of the doors are closed
I feel like  I've been a prisoner
I feel like  I've been a fool
Let people try to judge me
When they're not in my shoes
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
Some people are only happy
When they can watch you fail
And to them, every day is
Another coffin nail
I think that  I've found the answer
I think that, at last,  I know
We've only got one lifetime
So make your life your own
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say
I live my way
I live my way
I live my way
I live my way
Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I have sailed to many lands Now  I make my final journey
On the bow  I stand West is where  I go
Through the night  I plough Still my heart, calculate and pray As the compass swings, my will is strong I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time, clouds that hide the sun
But  I know, but  I know, but  I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks The sirens call my name Lash my hands onto the helm Blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now
As sunrise comes, the darkness left behind
For eternity  I follow on, there is no other way
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But  I know, but  I know, but  I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset, they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free Carried forward by the waves Nowhere left to run, navigator's son Chasing rainbows all my days Where  I go  I do not know I only know the place  I've been Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so Nothing's real until you feel
Dying swans, twisted wings Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life In this garden of fear
I have seen many things in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home
Wilderness, house of pain Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind, dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see, it's not real Those who know will not tell All is lost, sold your souls To this brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
Dragon  Kings, dying  Queens Where is salvation now?
Lost my life, lost my dreams Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned In this brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
A brave new world In a brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
In a brave new world A brave new world
Dying  Swans, twisted wings Bring this savage back home
If you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father  I see And in a movement he beckons to me And in a moment the memories are all that remain And all the wounds are reopen again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
There are times when  I feel  I'm afraid for the world
There are times  I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now?  Is it really happening?
Don't know why  I feel this way Have  I dreamt this time, this place? Something vivid comes again into my mind And  I think  I've seen your face Seen this room, been in this place Something vivid comes again into my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have  I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true The dream is true, the dream is true
Think  I've heard your voice before
Think  I've said these words before
Something makes me feel  I just might lose my mind
Am  I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that  I have lost my mind
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realisation
That  I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
I get up, put on the light Dreading the oncoming night Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again Nothing that  I contemplate Nothing that  I can compare To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors Lost in a paradox Lost and time is spinning Lost, a nightmare  I retrace Lost, a hell that  I revisit Lost, another time and place Lost, a parallel existence Lost, a nightmare  I retrace
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause  I'm alive I only dream in black and white To save me from myself
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
Azazel's beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the only one
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen  Angel but  I've risen again
And the power is inside me,  I've decided to pray
As  I wait for  Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and  I wait for the day
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the only one
You and only  God would know
What could be done
You and only  God will know
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of my world?

All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
' Cause  I am the chosen one
Yeah
Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells
No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you, they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you will die and live again
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood your genius
Out of the silent planet Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of  Gods Of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty The punishment is death for all who live The punishment is death for all who live
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet Come the  Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the  Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you Before you know the crime, it's all too late Before you know the crime, it's all too late
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what, we'll never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
I will hope, my soul will fly
So  I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And  I will live forever
The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate

Never been here before
But  I'm coming back tomorrow
For the real pain, a cold rain again
Nice day for a crucifixion
Heard a new prediction
That we can all be saved, so  I'll have
One more for the road
Play it again
One more for the road
Never heard this before
That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing if we sing along
Cold day, we can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die?
Hey, let's burn
One more for the road
Give me the same again
One more for the road
Well,  I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line
Waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay
So let's burn
One more for the road
Play it again
One more for the road
There's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But  I've heard that we can't save them
So give me the same again
There's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than  Hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the road
One more for the road
Play it again
One more for the road
And then you dream
Of a world with only windows
Inside you, you can hide you
You know
And then the night
You're just another empty shadow
No questions, no answers
No one to scream at you
Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know
Hey, you, you're just master of the moon
And then the eyes
If you look at them they'll blind you
Who are you?  What are you?
Why do you scream at me?
Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know
Hey, you!
Master of the moon
We can shake you, make you over
We just need some time
To shed some light upon your darkness
We need your mind
And then you dream again
In a world that only you know
Inside you, you can hide you
No one to scream at you
Turn around and when you face the sun
We can make you be like everyone you know
Oh turn away and never face the sun
You'll never make me be like you
I'm master of the moon
If  I could sleep at night then somehow  I'd see Why everything's wrong Or maybe it's just me
Does anybody know this place that  I'm in?
Why  I might be alone
Imagination is a terrible thing
What if  I'm wrong?
But here's what  I've been thinking
It must be the end of the world
What ever happened to the rock and roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And  I don't hear a sound
It's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitution
Don't get emotional, but we're out of time
The melody's gone
Fools have got the sunshine
If  I'm mistaken and  I see you again
Don't leave me alone
Maybe tomorrow
Could be the end of the world
Don't make wishes
Don't waste time
Call the ones you hate
You'd say  I'm sorry but they'll have to wait
For the end of the world
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Fingers scratching blackboards make cowards of the brave
A natural reaction from the cradle to the grave
Rats and bats and spiders and little things that crawl
Never made me tremble,  I'm not bothered, not at all
Then  I saw you
Something new inside of me
But what's this shaking?
You made me shiver, shiver
Cemetery midnights, walking on the dead
Never seemed to matter, it's all inside your head
Names are only letters mentioned on a stone
And if you're going somewhere you're going it alone
Then  I saw you
Something new inside of me
Felt this shaking
You gave me shivers
Magic charms and voodoo and all those other spells
Never made impressions and  I never slept so well
If  I had a nightmare,  I'm sure that  I would know
I really don't remember, but  I'm sure it isn't so
Then  I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shaking?
Turn out the light it won't matter
A bucket of blood,  I'm still fine
A black cat's only a colour
But you can do it every time
Time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Bless me, father,  I must go away
To save us from the one's who don't believe
Confess me, father,  I have sinned
But maybe angels really sing
For the man who would be king
We laugh at your religion
You people of the sand
We have no superstition
You can read it in our hands
Forgive me, father, for the change we bring
But it's all for the man who would be king
Don't leave a body standing
Not the holy, not the small
Deliver us from evil
If it's yours we want it all
Lately, father,  I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be king
How can right be ever wrong?
We are glory, we are stronger than you
We never got an answer
It's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
Our hearts just ran too fast
Curse me, father, for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be king
We never got an answer
The question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing
I haven't found the time
Oh no, they're at it again, looking inside my secrets
Coming through cracks before  I mend the wall
Get out cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me?
Places where  I can hide can't get much smaller
I have invisible dreams where no one can touch me
Maybe  I'll find a way to disappear
No one moves and no one dies
Just the eyes
I've run as fast as  I can thinking they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath, a waste of time
Feel like digging a hole, going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shine
I'll be lost so no goodbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyes
Oh no, they've done it again, sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means me
In my invisible dreams when no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and  I'd be free
I'll be lost so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyes
Magic numbers, even sacrifice
I can't find a way cause nothing stops the eyes
When a milion miles from nowhere
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all alone
She was never in the circle
Or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it
Oh, the less they seemed to care
Sold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who, it's only why
She's living the lie
Living the lie
When you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for stairs to  Heaven
Or wander through the halls?
He was only dedicated
To the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of straw
No ticket, no admission
Too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lie
Living the lie
How bad do you want it?
How far will you go?
If you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stay
What about the pictures
That smile from magazines?
The ultimate temptation
Our new  Kings and all our  Queens
Such heat and too much pressure
Not worth the try
No more for them
Now it's  I
And no more living the lie
Living the lie
Oh, why?
Live the lie
I think  I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door that  I've been through before
Congratulations, at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the night
I think  I'm never coming after, after all
Now  I've become the cat
Who always lets you know that
I am,  I am stronger than the wind
I am,  I am sin
I am,  I am stronger without you
I am
For all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold, or the story's never told
Investigation, at last  I've found my light
And we shine
So now  I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this that
I am,  I am stronger than the wind
I am,  I am sin
I am,  I am better without you
I am
I think  I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door, that locked me in before
Congratulations, now that you've seen my light
After all
And when  I become the cat
I'll always let you know that
I am,  I am stronger than the wind
I am,  I am sin ( I am)
I am,  I am stronger without you
I am ( I am)
Oh,  I am,  I am
I am everyone
I am,  I am ( I am) better without you ( I am)
I am
I am,  I am stronger than before
I am,  I am more ( I am)
I am,  I am ready to go on
I am
Oh, yeah! ( I am)
One night when the stars were right
For the gypsy queen
And she found she could drag you down
To a place that's in between it all
She's a madman with a delicate hand
And evil eyes
And  I've heard she'll only say a word
But that's enough to satisfy
Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go
She's not above
Death by love
One spell from the wishing well
And you're nevermore
A bad start for the sacred heart
' Cause the end has come before the beginning
Knee deep in the darkest sleep
But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky
And never feel the fall to come
Strong men die
But what a way to go
She's not above
Death by love
Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die
But what a way to go
You've got symptoms of
Death by love
She's not above
Death by love
Don't ask why
Don't even guess about it
All men die
But this is death by love
Help me, save me
I've just crossed the line where reason might betray me
Wake me, oh, shake me
Send a message to my brain before they take me
How can  I get through to you
That wishes just come true?
In dreams
Oh, don't go, no, don't dare
' Cause the journey drives you mad before you get there
Help me, oh save me
I'll be glad to give you back the hand you gave me
How  I can get through to you
That wishes do come true?
In dreams
In your dreams
If  I'm a river then you're the sea
Somewhere you'll find me alone and swimming here in ecstasy
If  I am silence you must be scream
But  I can't hear you,  I'm in a place that you've just never seen before
No, don't go, you'll never save me
I've just slapped away that helping hand you gave me
Don't wake me, no, don't you shake me
Here's a message from my brain, you'll never take me
How do  I get through to you
That wishes do come true?
In dreams
In my dreams
Bring me down, drag me away from  Heaven
But look out, angels guard the door
We all choose pain if pleasure is ordinary
Then we beg for more and more and more
Oh, lock me up in an institution and throw away the key
Then  I'm free
The prisoner of paradise
Take me down,  I've gone too high, so hurry
How can this be real?
I paid for the ride and got wishes for eternity
And here's one more,  I wish that you would steal them
Tie me down and don't believe me if  I say  I'm free
It's still me
The prisoner of paradise
Bring me down, if  I could start all over
Would  I do the same?
Oh,  I'd try for a while, then hunger for the recipe
And all  I'd hear is, " Isn't it a shame?"
Oh, wrap me up in some chains and you can push me out to see
Cover me up with the ocean then  I'm free
The prisoner of paradise
Silence, we hunt for the  Queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play, hey hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence, we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh, to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small  Gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon
Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's alright
No confessions, not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down?
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's alright
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now  I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spider
Don't ask why, it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation?
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her
You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you find inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness behind your smile you scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh once  I heard that they were fantasy
But in the darkness behind their smiles they scream
Scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream 'cause they never started
Scream
No pain, no sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway, about to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream 'cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream 'cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again, again, again, again
I'm all right,  I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night, black as heaven
So no one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh she's all right, tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn, takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
I'm all right,  I'm crossing over
I can disappear, gone
Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun
You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling as the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword and you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You got to push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel, push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling as your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue the hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save you
You got to push
Break the body down, oh push
Out of my way,  I'll push
You better push
You got to push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way, we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push
Push
He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty, a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty, burn in fire
Guilty
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty, a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty, hope you burn in fire
Guilty
Guilty, the great pretender
Guilty
You're guilty, just surrender
' Cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time you'll see
Guilty, a liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty, a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty, the great pretender
Guilty
Guilty, just surrender
You're guilty
Guilty, guilty
Guilty, a liar, liar
Guilty, you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender
Guilty
You're so guilty
Oh oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder and she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw away child
' I'll make you safe and warm'
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is ' No more, little girl'
Don't see her any more
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today  I heard that she was dead
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw away child
Someone's thrown away their children
You can hear them only if you try
Sing for the runaway children
Goodbye
( Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw away child)
( Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw away child)
Someone had a dream
Never been to  London, never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices coming from the radio? ( Radio)
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music, couldn't really understand, no, no, no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture shining from a magazine?
But somewhere down the line
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future he was sure that it was just the past
Someone had a dream
Only this one ended lost inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah!
Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in colour, just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row, so on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
Hey, that's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more?  Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock, same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more?  Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason, one more chance

Aliens:  Please continue
I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Putting out the spark
Leave them in the dark
Forever
I can wait for you
Your end is my life
All lies are true
Secrets of the heart
You can take them all
To heaven
I don't feel pain or sorrow
The child's a man tomorrow
Crossing the line, then he's mine
Don't care which god you follow
Whose promises you swallow
Time and again, we must meet at the end
It's all right
When the music is over
Come on and dance
For the lord of the last day
I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Secrets of the heart
Leave them in the dark
Forever
Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes
I just can't seem to fight it anymore
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
But it seems that  I have heard that song before
And the voices begin to sing
" Come home!"
I have seen some evil as  I've walked upon the earth
But this is way beyond what eyes can see
Wicked is as wicked does and if  I lose control
Is this the way that hell is gonna be?
Have  I fallen too far to rise?
Been burning too long in the fire
Then it all falls down
Tearing the night away
It must be fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Now before my demons roll the night across my eyes
I tremble as  I wait perhaps to sin
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
And all  I do is let the beast come in
Have  I fallen too far to rise?
I've been standing too long in the fire
Let it all fall down
Tearing the night away
It must be fever dreams
From the outside – fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Welcome to sundown
Welcome to the dark
Could it be that evil has heroes?
Bring everybody down
Celebration
Passing of the light
Giving up your spirit to the night
You'll turn to stone ( Turn to stone)
Just forever
You'll turn to stone ( Turn to stone)
Here comes a fire
We'll burn it to the ground
Inside the page lies the power
We've turned it all around
Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul
You'll turn to stone ( Turn to stone)
Just forever
You'll turn to stone, turn to stone
All pray for a miracle
But the wishes in the well have all gone dry
There's no way for a miracle
It's not the way you live it's how you'll die
Welcome to sundown
Welcome to the dark
Could it be that evil has heroes?
We've turned it all around
Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul
You'll turn to stone ( Turn to stone)
Just forever
You'll turn to stone
You'll turn to stone ( Turn to stone)
Aliens:  Concerning the inhabitants of  Otherworld.  There are many similarities to be found, parallel to our own society.  The individual must be absorbed.  The collective must be as one.  Feed my head!
Hiding in a corner
Waiting for the storm
Maybe they'll forget about me
Avoid connection
Still they say you always surrender
All the smiling faces
Promising the sun
Another way of breaking you down
All is lost, hope is dead
Feed my mind, fill my head
Hope is gone, the spell's been said
Fill my mind, feed my head
Waiting for my number
To climb upon the cross
Maybe they'll forget about me
Must avoid detection
But they say you'll still go down
Safe in dreams
Away from where they are
Let me be nowhere
Just another star
Safe in night
The shadows cloak their eyes
Take me to nowhere
Where everybody flies
All is lost, hope is dead
Feed my mind, fill my head
Hope is gone ( Gone), the spell's been said

Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that  I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once again
Look for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never die
I might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Some day soon  I'll be rising again
Higher than the sun
I have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence,  I am light
Oh, look for a sign, is it me?
No, don't believe with only eyes
Speak to the blind 'cause they see
Truth is just a circle
Spinning round until it meets the lies
Then dies
I am a rock and you are glass
Never broken, never last
And if you're in my way  I'll knock you down
If it's a joke  I'll never laugh
Here's exactly how  I see you in the light
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
Gonna sleep with the devil's daughter
I am your shock
I am your shame
Another face without a name
And if you think  I'm angry, just come over
I need to tell just who you are
My description of the world  I've seen so far
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna marry the devil's daughter
I am a rock and you are glass
If it's a joke, nobody laugh
And even when you know you're guilty, still you're right
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
Like a spark in the fire
Dust in the sand
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna run with the devil's daughter
Run, run, run, run, run away
Someone said You'll light up the universe
It's there in your head then
Crazy comes to call
Break me down
I'm only an everyone
Running from free Running for me
And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Again
Someone said Forever was yesterday So open your head when Crazy comes around
Break me down
I'm only an innocent
Howl at the moon
Knowing that soon
And though it's always confusing
I'm losing my insanity
Round and round
Like the wheels in my mind
Round and round
And down and down and round
And down and round
Someone said
Believe in your other side
It's there in your head and
Waiting for a ride
Break me down
Oh, once  I was everything
Breaking the law
Quick on the draw
And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Turn round slowly
Tell us what you see
Oh no, the fly got the spider
And now he's chasing me
Change comes slowly
But this is what you'll be
Somehow it snows in the summer
And the sun is freezing me
Pain comes easy
If pleasure will let go
Oh,  I still remember
And this is how  I know
Rain falls slowly
Here it cuts you down
Oh no, we're all one another
Oh no,  I'm caught in an otherworld
Rainbows and blue skies
Are black and white
Killed in their sleep by the queen
We have forsaken
Beginnings and taken the end,  Amen
We've been forsaken
Beginnings and given the end,  Amen
Time moves slowly
But here it never ends
Oh, we're all one another
Oh no,  I'm caught in an otherworld
It has been a thousand years since the once powerful planet of  Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and countless millennia since the days of the great magicians.  An expedition of alien voyagers came upon the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen moisture, they unlocked a written history of  Blessing from its almost undiscovered tomb.  So begins the story of  Magica
It was a time of celebration.  The  Book of  Magica and the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the good of the people were being honored in all the great cities of the world.  There was however an exception.  Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans for survival
The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal the forces of  Evilsyde to begin the attack and ultimate capture and destruction of  Magica.  The spells from the  Book would be used to turn all of those unwilling to join  Evilsyde into statues of stone and send their spirits to  Otherworld, where they would eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to drive  Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the necessity of the  Book and its incantations forever
Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive preparations and although the battle was well-fought by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed.  Their assault was well-planned and executed to a fault.  After overwhelming their initial opposition, they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the  Book of  Magica rested.  They possessed a much weaker form of magic themselves, and although it would be normally quite useless against the strength of  Magica, the inability of the  Wizards to gather themselves together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the  Book and its followers
The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and executioner known as  Shadowcast.  His presence could make the naughtiest of children become obedient and inspire great fear among the adult population.  This man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and answerable to none.  His reign would plunge  Blessing into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the coming of his master,  Astoroth, the  Grand  Duke of  Hell
The capture of  Magica did not, however, mean that  Shadowcast had finally reached his goal.  He must now find and conquer  Blessing's  Grand  Wizard and legendary hero,  Eriel.  Eriel, who defeated  Evilsyde time and again with his understanding and use of  Magica's spells.  He would be the last stumbling block to total domination
Eriel had removed himself from the general population in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of his  God.  Lately though, he had been visited by many temptations in his dreams.  Promises of pleasure, riches and power raced through his sleeping mind.  All these lures had been placed there by  Shadowcast, hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant man and his own villainous forces.  Eriel however had resisted these solicitations and was now warned of some impending danger.  He managed to make his way to the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt to rescue the  Book of  Magica, but not before he was able to memorize the most important of  Magica's charms.  The spell of  Restoration
The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward the transmission of spirits to  Otherworld.  One by one the good souls of  Blessing were turned to stone and sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble  Eriel remained.  The spectacle that followed was meant to degrade  Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly supplicants of  Evilsyde, but true to his indominantable bearing, he promised to return and banish  Evilsyde forever.  Then he was gone
The horrors of  Otherworld are now revealed to the masses huddled together for some small measure of comfort.  First the adults were separated from their children amid cries and pleas for help.  Next the old ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near the assimilation site.  They were guarded by monstrous, misshapen denizens of this mist- shrouded netherland, who constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain and extermination.  Intermittent bursts of flame shot up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to consume anyone in its path.  Shrieks of torment could be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further unnerving the petrified captives.  Only one seemed unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil.  Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the men and women with whom he was confined.  When they all became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to them softly as an adult to his children. " Long ago you entrusted me to protect the  Book of  Magica and to be faithful to its special purpose.  It must seem that  I have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but fear not!  This hell is only a test of your faith and resolve.  The power of  Magica did not vanish in fire.  On the third day  I will evoke the spell of  Restoration.  United we shall return to  Blessing and, armed with the strength of  Magica, we will be triumphant.  Many will perish, but  Magica and our souls cannot be restored until three days have passed.  Take heart my friends.  Victory awaits you."
Even magic has its limitations and, as  Eriel explained to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a waiting period of at least three days.  One third of the souls of  Blessing would be melded into the  Evilsyde collective before  Eriel could be effective with the words of  Restoration
The old ones were the first to go.  Cries of encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned as they trudged slowly to their fate.  One by one they were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise.  With each burst  Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt for his part in this slaughter of his charges.  If only he had not become so complacent.  He above all should never have let this tragedy transpire
In the compound holding the young adults, an insurrection of sorts was occurring.  A boy of seventeen years called  Challis was urging an uprising among his captured companions.  Futile though it was, it earned  Challis a place in the cell adjoining  Eriel's.  His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by  Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious conversation.  Eriel knew his time of assimilation was near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before the three day waiting period for  Restoration was ended.  Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee  Eriel's termination but couldn't abandon his duties on  Blessing until all was secure.  Would there be enough time?
Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in  Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not to be lost.  He instructed  Challis to remove all anger from his mind and hate from his heart.  Only the pure could receive and transmit this most important of spells.  Convinced that this young man was ready, he joined with his spirit and gave him these words. " Sanasha  Gorath  Sollis  Arcanna."  Words that would resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time
Over two days had passed before  Shadowcast was ready for travel to  Otherworld to deliver  Eriel to his fate.  His journey through  Otherworld was marked by what could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms.  Upon his arrival he instructed the guards to take him straight to  Eriel.  Once there he announced with great satisfaction that he would personally supervise  Eriel's execution in a matter of hours.  Nearby,  Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and punches until he could no longer speak.  Eriel's heart sank.  Had he misjudged  Challis and entrusted his people's future to a reckless youth?  Eriel's mind wandered to his own younger days.  He too had been restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these traits and become the adored leader of  Blessing.  He wondered if  Challis had yet experienced love.  Eriel himself had turned his back on the beautiful and innocent  Annica.  She was his intended from birth, but he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his duties to  Blessing and the  Book
One hour remained in the wait for  Restoration.  Eriel's hopes were soaring.  Surely  Shadowcast would fail once again.  But as that thought surfaced, so did  Evilsyde's dark leader.  Eriel was led away with head held high, but as he passed  Challis he gave just the slightest nod.  A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth.  Eriel was then taken to the assimilation chamber and strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of the room.  Seconds were all that stood in the way of resurrection or destruction.  Shadowcast walked to  Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old nemesis.  Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted, but at the last moment  Shadowcast seemed to reconsider and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin.  The arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss,  Eriel was no more.  Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy.  Never again to be slaves.  Now to be masters
Challis heard the cheering and knew that  Eriel had passed without time to summon the spell.  Now only he could influence the future.  He heard the rattling of armor and realized they were coming for him.  Soon the guards appeared and dragged the struggling  Challis from his confinement.  One of his jailers struck him a mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger left him.  He was sure of what he must do.  Thunder starts from silence and he would be thunder
Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the cross.  Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had any last thing to say before assimilation.  Challis smiled and said he did.  Then with an evil laugh,  Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his question was only a final killing joke.  It was now or never.  As the arm fell in signal,  Challis shouted out the spell. " Sanasha  Gorath  Sollis  Arcanna" and all hell actually broke loose.  Challis and the good folk of  Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of light.  Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy.  Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward him.  At the last moment he cloaked his body with his unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath as the light touched the cloth.  The robe erupted into flame and then there was nothing.  Surely  Shadowcast was also consumed by fire!  But that tale would not yet be told.  Now as each remaining citizen of  Blessing was transported instantly back to their home, they found themselves standing among thousands of recognizable stone statues.  These monuments represented their fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament to the dangers of evil and the power of  Magica
Now came the time of mourning.  Funeral pyres brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow could be heard across the land long after the flames had sputtered and died.  When the prolonged periods of grieving had ended, the citizens and their council directed attention to the task of anointing a new leader and protector of the restored  Book of  Magica.  The choice seemed a simple one.  Challis had resurrected the populace and the  Book, but many questioned his youth and inexperience
The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached.  The candidates were summoned to the sacred place.  Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them all.  Only  Challis lacked a champion and it seemed certain that he would be passed over. " Will anyone speak for the boy?" asked the council.  The question was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to cast their votes.  Then the quiet was broken.  A handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with traces of gray, spoke: " Challis must be chosen.  This is the secret  I have carried with me for all these years.  Although  I was once rebuffed by my only true love,  Eriel, our brief union produced the young man standing before you.  Eriel was never to know that he had sired this free spirit, but he will live on through his son's achievements if you now find him worthy."  So spoke  Annica, mother of  Challis
The decision was now reached quickly.  Annica's revelation left little doubt in the minds of the councillors that  Challis should indeed succeed his father.  Evilsyde had been defeated,  Shadowcast was hopefully destroyed,  Challis had been chosen to lead his people and, despite the huge number of casualties, the old way of life began again.  But, evil does not easily die.  Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist in his attempts to challenge and conquer  Blessing.  Great battles would be fought.  Brave heroes would rise to the occasion and legends were created.  There was, of course, the unforgettable  War of the  Darkpeace when  Challis...  Ah!  But that's another story
And then the dark
I've been way beyond your universe
And  I've seen things that  I should never tell
But here  I go again,  I just can't keep it to myself
The story of my world and how  I fell
Round and round
The square inside the circle
And still  I shake the same
At the rhythm of her name
Electra
Electra
I believed in love and miracles
So how can  I be blamed for what  I've done?
And if it's still a sin to hide the best parts for yourself
Then  I have sinned but only just begun
There's no thunder, no lightning
Just a gentle breeze
To warn you that something
Will bring you to your knees
Round and round
You're caught inside the circle
Still  I shake the same
At the mention of her name
Electra
Electra
Hey,  I've been way beyond your universe
And  I've come back to introduce to you
The fear of the heart, just try to keep it from yourself
And it will be the last thing that you'll do
Round and round
You're caught inside a circle
And you will shake the same
At the magic of her name
Electra
Electra
I am here to show my changes
Not to change what  I've become, no, no
I'm not alone and she will testify
That it's the best thing that  I've done, oh, oh, for
Electra
Electra
Inside the walls  I've made
To keep out all who reach for me
I might have lost my way
And  I can't come out again
Don't come around here anymore
You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters
In your mind there just like me
Have  I erased all sense of touch?
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say  I need
Sometimes  I think  I need
Sometimes  I know  I need
New parts for my brain
Most dreams, they're black and white
But  I must color mine
Each day's another endless night of screaming
Of shouting at the outside
Someone let me in
Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional man
Sometimes they say  I need
Sometimes  I think  I need
Sometimes  I know  I need
New parts for my brain
Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands
Institutional, institutional man

Information please
Here's what  I know
Soon we'll all go
We must fade to
Black
Hey, liar, tell me your intentions are good
Knowing it could be a lie
I see how you rise to question the eyes
Of anyone who promises pain
Contagious, something like a virus of love
Making the pleasure seem real
Another killing by the villain
Another body on the ground
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart
Cat crazy, never the predictable one
Asleep in the sun now the strike
Possession today then send it away
After all the joy's in the taking
Another beating by the villain
Another angel fallen down
Here comes the master of destruction again
Perfect for the part
Hunter of the heart
Another burning by the devil
And another diamond turned to glass
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart
Hunter of the heart
All you see down there
Could be yours for the taking
All your heart's desire
Would be yours

Someone just like you
Crackle,  Crackle
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
It's a crazy world we live in
And  I'm leaving it today
For another institution
Where crazy people play
Every time  I climb the mountain And it turned into a hill
I promised me that  I'd move on And  I will
I,  I, good for nothing
Going nowhere, so they say
Hey
Someone, give me blessings For they say that  I have sinned
That's when  I crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind On strange highways
On strange highways
Hey you,  I want your number
Don't even wonder
We do things our way here
Questions, these are forbidden We got no answers, believe us anyway
So here is my confession
It's the only broken rule
Sometimes  I crawl inside of me
Where  I can be the fool
On strange highways
On strange highways
You can't see the other side
And you shall cross over
You can't leave the other side
If you say,  I will
Every time  I climb the mountain And it turned into a hill
Well,  I promised me  I'd disappear
And now  I know  I will
So someone, give me blessings For the times you say  I've sinned
So  I can crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind
On strange highways
On strange highways
Questions, they're forbidden Hey you, what's your number? We've got no answers Don't you even wonder
On strange highways
Came to the sunset scene
To find out who's inside of me
Some lies  I've never seen But this one lie is on the silver screen
In between real and dream
Like a scream
Hollywood black
I'm 
caught in the middle
Hollywood black
Same story, different eyes
Here's where the hero never, never dies
Can't you tell That all the wishes you've made Have filled up the world
Hollywood black
Caught in the middle
Hollywood black
Yeah
Oh,  Hollywood black
Right in the middle
Too late too little
Back to the street again Or was that yesterday? Another yesterday's gone, gone
Back in the jungle
Running with the animals
Howling at the shine of the spotlight
Those dreams are made of glass
You throw just one stone
And then there goes your last window
Can't you tell
That every wish that you made
Filled up the world
Hollywood black
Caught in the middle
Hollywood black
Hollywood black
Right in the middle
Ah,  Hollywood black
Hollywood black
Caught in the middle
Too late too little
And only the fools come back
Cause  Hollywood is black
Good night, we're closing again
Come back, we're open tomorrow
We've finished today
I'm just staying away
We know what's good for the brain
Oh, plastic dreams and fast machines
Pushing it to the limit
Girls and boys who think that noise
Is music in the air
Twisted felon, stay awhile
Here's your invitation
Dirty rags and body bags
Evilution
Hello, we're open once more
Come in, you need no appointment
We're thinking in time
That you'll move down the line
And represent the business in hell
Well, well
Tell her hope is gone but you carry on
We can set the soul free
All is lost so what's it costs
To listen anyway
The world upstairs where no-one cares
Is just about to crumble
See it through we'll burn for you
Evilution company
Oh, neon names play neon games
Showing it to the public
I hate you and you hate me
And everybody smiles
So money talks and no-one walks
But everybody's crawling
Golden rags and body bags
Evilution
Hello, good night, it's me
I'm open again
Come back, come in, good bye
We're closed
Give me a choice between pleasure and pain
I choose pain
Another day without a heartbeat How can your heart beat If they've taken it away
For the first time, just don't think about it
Take the water and wash your face with pain
You can take away the power Your finest hour It's when you laugh in their faces
For the first time just forget about it
Take a hammer and pound yourself with pain
Bury my bones on the moon
If they never should find me it would be too soon
Give me a choice between power and pain
I choose pain
Oh, bury my bones on moon
If they never should find me it would be too soon
For the first time just forget about
Take the water and wash your face with pain
Pain, oh, just forget about pain
Forget about the pain
Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain!
Here we go again, must be delirious
Can't close my eyes
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious
Does this go on and on forever
Sometimes in the dark  I feel invincible
I wonder why
I hear voices out of shadows And shadows never lie
Helter skelter
Now give me shelter
Use the children like toys
Eat your lover Then find an another There be good little boys Boys will be boys
I got two hands to hold you
Two arms around you
The master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you
Two hands to help you
Put one foot in the grave
Here we go again, must be delirious
Can't close my eyes, no
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious
Helter skelter
Now, give me shelter
My brain is twisting again
I could be dreaming this
No,  I'm screaming this
No more, no
She heard this song before Daddy's at the door Just to say  I love you
Please, please don't let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight?
Somebody make it right
I say give her the gun Look at him run away
Give her the gun
Before the next one comes along And doesn't pay
He, dragged into the cold
Momma sold her soul For one more ride to heaven
Please someone let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight?
Can anyone make it right?
I say give him the gun Look at her run away
Oh give him the gun
Before the next one comes along And doesn't pay
Simply unforgivable Destruction of the heart Does anybody care?
Make yourself invisible Be blinded by the light
We're hiding away
What would they say
She played this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say hello
Now in a different world Is it all beginning again tonight
Oh  I got to make it right
I say give her the gun
Look at him run away
Oh give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
Give her the gun Look at him falling down
Oh give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
' Cause it goes round and round and round and round
Oh, you've been surprised again
Pulled like a leaf to the waterfall
Everybody's just pretending
I thought that you'd learn by now
Oh, think about it one more time
What have you got when the  God is gone
Clouds don't have a silver lining
And all you ever get is rain
Cause you can't get 
blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
It isn't once upon a time
When nobody falls and the hero flies
That victims got to fit the crime
And nobody goes down with you, you, you
Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
No, you can't get blood from a stone
No blood from a stone
Go on and leave me alone
And  I know it's a shock
To learn you can't
You can't, you can't get blood from a rock!
Did you ever believe in your dreams before?
Were you always afraid of the dark?
Is the edge of the world always in your head?
Does the gun point straight at your heart?
It used to come just when you sleep
But now, it's only a shout away
You always seem to find the sun
But this time, the sun is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put out the flame
Bring down the rain
You were told that the storm would just roll on by
That the thunder was made in your mind
And the heat in the night was to keep you warm
And the truth could be told by a lier now
You always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put down the flame
Bring down the rain
Shake up, break up, everybody make up
Everything's always the same
Trapped down, trapped down, everybody back down
Bring down the rain
You always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Don't play the game
Bring down the rain
Put out the flame
Bring down the rain
It's the shake up, break up, everybody make up
Well, it's always the same
Trapped down, cracked down, everybody back down
Won't you bring down all the rain
You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you?
Don't let them hear you say any more
Nothing's really safe around here
We are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's going to change around here, no
Crack in the ceiling, hole in the wall
They bend you over but you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes, one in the hand
They'd make you over but they can't understand you
You're always going to be the wild one
Pretend that all you really feel is pain
Just hide behind some sorrow
How sad but you'd do it all again
Nobody changes around here
Cat in the cradle, man in the moon
They'd make you over but it's too soon to know, no
I smell smoke in the kitchen, fire in the hall
The train is coming and you can hear it calling
You're always going to be the wild one
Wild, wild one
Crack in the ceiling, hole in the wall
They bend you over now you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes, one in the hand
They'd make you over but they can't understand you
You're always going to be the wild one
Wild, wild, wild, wild one
There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now, it's just a lie
No jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down
You can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
Be another number
At least you'd be alive
Or you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to  Hell
And the answers screaming
In a voice you know so well
You, you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to run
You, you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sun
Get ready to run
Right
So take a walk with a wild one
It's the way that  I've found
You can turn it upside down
You, you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to run
You, you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sun
You, you, hey you
You were born on the sun
How do you feel right now?
How does it feel to be alone?
How do you feel right now?
Tell me
Hey angel, what's your situation?
Hey angel
Where would you be right now?
Waiting to taste your next tomorrow?
Where would you be right now?
Tell me
Was the pain too strong to take it any more So you turned off all the lights and shut the door
Hey angel, what's your destination?
Hey angel
Hey angel, we got a complication
Hey angel, oh, oh you're my angel, my angel
How do you feel right now?
How does it feel to be alone?
How do you feel right now?
How do you feel right now?
Oh angel
You're my angel
Angel, angel, angel
You're my angel
How do you feel right now?
What do you see?
Where would you be right now?
Hey angel what about me?
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason
Why she lives
She tries to be The perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most The ones who never give
It's between two hearts A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
We never have to ask her Why she's crying
The smile she had has been Kicked into a frown
But it still makes her day
To be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes? Can we ever break the spell?
No-one can tell
It's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation
Put on your party faces and come along Join in the big parade Here comes the camera Do you look as good as your sister?
Smile at the animals They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pages
Another way to spend a rainy  Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how
She makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
Everyone
It's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love, the kind of love
Between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
Looking on the inside
You're waiting for your life to walk away
Writing's on a wall
You just dream forever, forever
Face it, it's another day
And it's going to be the same tomorrow
The sun is going to go away So let it shine on, shine on, yeah, yeah
When you move to the rhythm of shadows
You can hide from the heat of the sun
' Cause if you dance to the beat of the darkness
You burn before the fire's begun
Then comes the night
You come alive
With night music
It keeps spinning around my head
Night music
It's all the things that you never said
And anywhere you are
There's night music
They're playing our night music
So open up your arms and let the night time in
Say the word and it begins
In the night you're the song and the singer
You can choose what the band's going to play
Write the words under cover of moonlight
Oh make some magic with the things that you say
Together we can kill the day
With our night music
You're the singer and  I'm the song
Night music
Where's the place we can belong
Playing night music
Here comes the night, you will survive
Dancing in the moonlight makes you feel alive
Oh make it all begin
Just open up the magic, let the night time in
Yeah, let it in
In the houses of the holy To the middle of the mystic sea At the cradle of the world There's a black cat screaming And it's not even midnight, no At the cradle of the world They're screaming for sanctuary They're screaming at you Lock up the wolves Lock up the wolves, yeah, yeah, yeah Now there's a cloud over heaven And a pain out of paradise In your corner of the world Turn your back on the children Does it feel like it's colder In your corner of the world They're screaming for sanctuary They're screaming at you Lock up the wolves Lock up the wolves Lock up the wolves Lock up the wolves Don't you let them get away Lock up the wolves before you play Or it's over Lock up the wolves Now don't you let them get away Don't you let them get away There's no back door to heaven Just a front door to hell In this corner of the world Now if you turn your back on the children Well, you'll feel it getting colder In your corner of the world
They're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves, yeah
Lock up the wolves, lock them up
Spent the night on the road
And never saw the miles go
Running away
I've got to get free from myself
Now stories were made to be told
And here's the one that  I know
Oh  I can't hide it any more
There's evil on  Queen  Street
Some evil up the road
I saw the house in the dark
It seemed to say, come touch me
I've got a heart
Open the door to my soul
Climb to the top of my stairs
And look into my windows
I can be your wishing well
There's no evil here on  Queen  Street
Let me in,  I can warm in the heat of your fire
It's no permanent sin to be bad if you're sorry
Let me go, you're a promise that comes from a liar
I don't know, if  I ever can wash all the evil away, hey
Struck a match at the dark
It screamed, no, no,  I love you
Together we're strong
You always believed what  I'd say, hey
But now the heat of the flame
Starts me to remember
There's no evil, no more evil
No evil on  Queen  Street
Just some smoke up in the air
No evil, no evil
He's just an ordinary man
No, he's never going to live forever
So he takes it where he can
Too many nights without a day
For the sake of being clever
He almost lost his way
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
You can't walk on water, don't try
You can't walk on water, my, my, my
They say there's ice inside his veins
He's the man of a thousand faces
Silver spoons and golden chains
He thought his heart was made of steel
But it never started pounding
Till they strapped him to the wheel
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
No matter what you try
You can't walk on water, my, my
You can't walk on water, don't even try
Somebody said we'll make him strong
He can give us all the answers
Tell us right and show us wrong
If you believe it, it's no lie
And there is an end to summer
' Cause the winter makes it die
He never looked above his head
And so he missed the things they said
He always thought that he could fly
Until they shot him from the sky
No matter how you try
You can't walk on water, can't burn the sun
You can't walk on water, can't walk on water
You can't, you can't
You can't, you can't, you can't
Walk on water
Walk on water
Walk on water
Don't try, no
It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it lies
Cause he was twisted
He was twisted, all right
He was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger but he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand cause he could see them inside
Where they were twisted
Oh so twisted
He could feel it they were twisted
Twisted up inside
Look inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free but they just won't let you go, no
No, no, no
Just a matter of time
They told me  I was guilty so  I thought  I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
And when  I told the truth they were sure it was a lie
Sure that  I would try
Sure of it
Sure of it
Cause  I'm so twisted
Well, he's twisted
I'm twisted
She's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away
He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart gets a taste of freedom, you better look out
He was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But  I've seen it before, it can make you crazy
Yes, the eyes are what you see
Why are they watching me?
She was ready to black and white
The colours were just too bright
She loved to fly but she hated falling
She was caught in the in between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light but she got darkness
Just when you think you're free
The eyes are what you see
Why are they watching me?
Why do they do the things they do?
Why are they watching me?
They're watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you
If only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friend
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes will it make you crazy, crazy, so crazy
Why are they watching me?
Why do they do the things they do?
Why are they watching me?
They are watching you
Watching you
Watching you, you, you
Watching you
My eyes can see inside tomorrow
My eyes can get next to you
Time flies on wings that just get stronger
My eyes are true
My eyes could see the body shaking
My eyes were clear and bright
Goodbyes are easy to remember
You can see the hurt still there in my eyes
I've fallen off the edge of the world
I've fallen from the top of the mountain
Just to rise again
I've seen it from heaven and hell I've seen it from the eyes of a stargazer
I want to be 
invisible
Just get me out of here
Could the dreamer be turning to stone
Rock and roll eyes
The colour of rainbows
, believer of lies
Rock and roll eyes
My eyes
Don't want to see the end of it all
Just get me out of here
Just get me out of here
Just get me out of here
Rock and roll eyes
The keeper of rainbows, collector of lies
Rock and roll eyes
Now rock and roll eyes
Tell rock and roll lies
And rock and roll lies
Never end
Rock and roll friends
With rock and roll trends
And rock and roll ends
With my eyes
Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Do you come alive when neon kills the sun?
Are you hypnotised?
Part of the illusion
Oh see how they run
It's the mystery
Poetry and passion
Innocence and fashion
Revolution, evolution ways
Night people
Are you satisfied
With the lessons that you're learning?
Is the fire really burning?
Do you know?
Hey, dream child
Promises are spoken
And promises are broken
Electric eyes that never let you
See them in the day
Night people
Night people
Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Do you come alive when neon kills the sunshine?
Are you hypnotised?
Innocence and fashion
Promises and passion
Evolution, revolution ways
And everybody stays
Night people
Night people, yeah
Do you like the dark?
Do you like the way it moves?
Are you hypnotised?
Paralysed
Revolution
Hey, dream child
You got electric eyes
Hey, dream child
Night people
Night, night people
All's well at the midnight hour
You're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness
Or the rumbling in the sky
Somewhere on the morning road
Just waiting for you
Some things that just could never be
Are calling up a spell, so you can see
Dream evil, the dark that you find In the back of your mind
Dream evil, dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real
The truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star
You could open up the door
Where things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell, so you can see
Dream evil, the dark that you find Can come out of your mind
Dream evil, take you away
Oh no, it's the midnight hour
Don't leave me alone
Those things that just should never be
Are calling up a spell, so you can see
Dream evil, dream evil
Dream evil, dream evil
Dream evil
Oh no, it's the midnight hour
Don't open the door
Don't go the edge of rainbows
Don't sleep anymore
You'll dream evil, you'll dream evil
You'll dream evil, dream evil
The night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places
Where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning
Were you dreaming, screaming
Trying to hide your burning heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Somebody start the game
And the dark will just get louder
As it shouts away the light
A shadow without a name
But when he wakes up in the morning
He just won't know, was he a hero
Trying to hide his burning heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Anybody can
Sunset superman
The night has a thousand eyes
But he moves in only places Where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies
And when you wake up in the morning
Were you dreaming, screaming
Trying to hide your broken heart
Before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Anybody can
Anybody can
Sunset superman

Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman
Sunset superman

There's perfect harmony In the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do For promises and a song
We are the innocent, we are the damned We were caught in the middle of the madness Hunted by the lion and the lamb
We bring you fantasy, we bring you pain It's your one great chance for a miracle Or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away All the fools sailed away, sailed away
We bring you beautiful, we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe
Or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
They sailed away, sailed away
And as we drift along
I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do
For promises and a song
We are the innocent, we cut, we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle
And a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds, and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness
Just lost like them
And part of all the pain they feel.  Yeah!
And all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Leaving nothing, nothing more to say
All the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful And they'll always let you in But doors are never open To the child without a trace of sin Sail away
Two faces on fire, no traces
Something has swallowed the night
You know that nothing
Can make it alright
Like candy emotion, too much
And sugar can turn to sand
You scream
But nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain?
Or do we see just what we are?
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two children, guns loaded Take aim and blow all the dreams away Too late for anything better to say
Are we just crazy with the pain?
Or do we see just what we are?
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two faces, no fire, no traces
Fever has turned to snow
Hearts break to show you
The way as you go
Are we just running from the pain?
Or do we see just what we are?
We're naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Two children on fire
Emotion burns higher
Guns loaded, blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain
Naked in the rain
Frightened by the pain
Naked in the rain
Seems  I've heard this song a thousand times before
He just wanted her, but she wants more
So build a wall, keep it all to herself
Oh
Always never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains, sad remains
Another victim of...
Overlove
Overlove
He was just the devil in a thin disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page, close the cage
Another victim of...
Overlove
Overlove, yeah
Overlove
Overlove, overlove, overlove
Mama never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mama's gone and come the dawn
You got another victim of...
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove, love, love, love, love
Overlove
Running with the wolf pack
Feel like  I'm never coming back
And every time, there's sunshine
I'm blind, yeah
I am everybody
And everyone that  I know is me
Everyone that  I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer, yeah
I'm another number
And you know the numbers must agree
But every time, the wind blows
I can't fly, why?
We take away tomorrow
And never see the end of today
Lock it up and send it away, forever
I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer
Cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer
Running with the wolf pack
Feel like  I'm never coming back
But maybe that was sunshine
That  I saw
I've heard about a rainbow
I've heard it makes you crazy
I think  I'm going crazy
Crazy 'cause  I see
I could have been a dreamer
I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer
Cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer
I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer
Cause dreamers never die, no
I could have been a dreamer
Dreamer
I could have been a dreamer
Dreamer
I could have been a dreamer
Dreamer
I could have been a dreamer
Give me shelter, shelter
I can face the day
Then  I'll just fade away
Give me shelter
Give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly The fire starts to die Then you open up your eyes Faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
We are evil And we are all divine Creations of the mind
We are pleasure
I see clearly
Who's behind the wall
Yes,  I can see us all
We're faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
Give me shelter, shelter, shelter
Give me shelter, shelter, shelter
Faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
When the fire starts to die And you open up your eyes There they are in the window Faces in the window
We are evil and divine Just creations of the mind
And faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Oh rain falls, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move, they're shaking all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain
Turn to face the train
Hey, it's magic, said the mother to the child
It's stronger than a smile
Let it go
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
Just when you think it's pretend
Here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever
Maybe we'll still just never know
Oh rain falls, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move, shaking all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire, magic, shaking all the earth
When a woman cries
Oh stars move, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, yeah
When a woman cries
When a woman cries
Yes, the best steel goes through the fire
And you seem to burn
The dead man's always a liar
Look out, there's another one learning
Too late for tomorrow
There's only today
So take your magic carpet ride
Hide in the rainbow
Hide in the rainbow
Oh the last one out of thunder
He will always survive
But if you are starting to wonder
No, no, you can never surrender
You see through the mystery
And now you can fly
So take your magic carpet ride
Hide in the rainbow
Oh to hide, yeah
Hide in the rainbow
Hide in the rainbow
Ride to the sun, yeah
Now the best steel goes through the fire
And you seem to burn
The dead man's always a liar
Look out, there's another one learning
Got to hide in the rainbow
Hide in the rainbow
Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Capatin's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright
Neon  Knights!
Neon  Knights!  All right!
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Capatin's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Again and again, again and again and again
Neon  Knights!
Neon  Knights!
All right!
We're a ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness that it needs
, yeah…
We're a laugh without a tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming… home!
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself But the only way is down
We don't come alone We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
And quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time If we're evil or divine We're the last in line
, yeah
We're the last in line, oh!
Two eyes from the east It's the  Angel or the  Beast
And the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
Yeah, we're the last in line, oh
Yeah!
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
You know we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way to go is down
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, oh
We're the last in line
See all we shine
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're a laugh without a tear
We're the far without the near
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
See how we shine
We're the last in line
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone
Oh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, oh
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Oh they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea, yeah
L O O K  O U T!  The sky is falling down!
L O O K  O U T!  The world is spinning round and round and round!
L O O K  O U T!  The sun is going black, black
L O O K  O U T!  It's never never never coming back,  L O O K  O U T!
Mhhh-hm-hmm
Yeah, yeah
Holy  Diver You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh, what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what  I mean?
Gotta get away Holy  Diver, yeah
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning You can hide in the sun 'til you see the light Oh, we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies Life's a never-ending wheel, say
Holy  Diver You're the star of the masquerade No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump; jump on the tiger You can feel his heart but you know he's mean Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Holy  Diver You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh, what's becoming of me?
  No!  No!
Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what  I mean?
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy  Diver, sole survivor You're the one who's clean
Holy  Diver,  Holy  Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you,  Holy  Diver
Oh,  Holy  Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Holy  Diver,  Holy  Diver
Oh,  Holy  Diver
Mhhh-hmmm-hmmm
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh well
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, heaven and hell
I can tell
Fool, fool
Oh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no
Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool
I'm a wheel,  I'm a wheel
I can roll,  I can feel
( And)  You can't stop me turning
'cause  I'm the sun,  I'm the sun
I can move,  I can run
But you'll never stop me burning
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the day,  I'm the day
I can show you the way
And look,  I'm right beside you
I'm the night,  I'm the night
I'm the dark in the light
With eyes that see inside you
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Well,  I can help you, you know  I can
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Just look at me and listen
I'm the man, the man, here go my hand
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
I'm the man on the mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
When there's lightning You know it always brings me down' Cause it's free
 
and  I see that it's me Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It went cold, lost my hold To the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and  I
We're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When  I see lightning You know it always brings me down' Cause it's free and  I see that it's me Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling you
Beware, look out!
There's no sight of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah, yeah, you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark
Woah

Hey The old ones speak of winter The young ones praise the sun And time just slips away Oh Running into nowhere Turning like a wheel And a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream, that's when we fly
So here is a dream for just you and  I We'll find the sacred heart Somewhere bleeding in the night Look for the light And find the sacred heart
Oh
Here we see the wizard Staring through the glass And he's pointing right at you!
Now, you can see tomorrow The answer and the lie And the things you've got to do, yeah
Oh
Sometimes you never fall
And ah
You're the lucky one
But oh
Sometimes you want it all
You've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night Oh, look to the light
( Guitar solo)
Well
You fight to kill the dragon
You bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sigh
You run along the rainbow And never leave the ground Still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key
It opens the door to let you be free
And find the sacred heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Run for the light
And you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard The sky begins to crack And he's looking right at you Quick Run along the rainbow Before it turns to black Attack!
And oh
Sometimes you never fall
And ah
You're the lucky one
Oh
And sometimes you need it all
You've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart
Yeah
Bleeding in the night
We'll find the sacred heart
She's a rumor in the night
It's crazy
You can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light
It's crazy
But you go anywhere
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She crouches the hunter
Ready to tell you
Another lie
Another lie
You could see the other side of someday
Feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway
You were wrong-wrong-wrong
She jumped at the moment
A chance to tell you
Another lie
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She jumps at the moment
She crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you
Another lie
Another lie
Why it's crazy
When you feel you're getting stronger
Why it's crazy
All the lies are getting longer
Another lie
Another lie
You're a dancer
But you're dancing on air
Just a matter of time till you fall
You're a dreamer, one night at the fair
But still you want it all
You're in danger, the last of a line
But the vision lasts forever
So just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and
You will fly
You're hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven, hungry for  Heaven
But you need a little  Hell
You're a runner
But you're chasing yourself
Feel a hot breath on your shoulder
Your emotion
Running cold, running warm
The young just getting older
We are sunlight
We can sparkle and shine and
Our dreams are what we're made of
Just hold on
You can make it happen for you
Reach for the stars and
You will fly
You're hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven, hungry for  Heaven
But you need a little  Hell
Hungry
You're hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven, hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven
You're hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven
So hungry for  Heaven
You're hungry for  Heaven
You're a dancer
But you're dancing on air
You're a dreamer, one night at the fair
You're hungry, hungry there for  Heaven
You're a runner in the night
Just a dreamer, but that's alright
You're hungry, hungry for  Heaven
Hungry, hungry for  Heaven
Hungry for  Heaven, hungry for  Heaven
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
There's a better thing that we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dries can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never, never going to die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming, let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Now love can be a whisper
But pain will always shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Go beat your heart
You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
Cause you think the world is round
And you never dance in moonlight
You run but you never move
You don't believe in some day
And the truth is what you prove
But it's all right
Well, it's all right
Just another day
Too many chains around you
You laugh but you never smile
And you don't belong in heaven
But you're here all the while
And it's all right
Well, it's all right
Just another day
Another day
Another day
Another day to let you down
Another way that they have found
Yes, another day, another way
Another way, another day
You never sing for pleasure
You only make the sounds
You never feel the magic
Cause you think the world is spinning round for you
But it's all right
Yes, it's all right
Well, it's all right
Just another day
Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real alright
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We're climbing the stairs, going down
And never higher
We're fallen  Angels
You know something came
To me in a dream
The crack of a gun
And a bloody scream
Then  I could see the faces and
Why  I was holding the gun
And the world began to die
For fallen  Angels, falling down
Fallen  Angels, come gather round
It's a criminal world
And we all get to play
You're a criminal
Sins of the children
Never get washed away
We're fallen  Angels, going down
All of you fallen  Angels
Hey  Angels, gather round
We are screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real alright
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We're climbing the stairs, going down
And never higher
We're fallen  Angels, fallen  Angels
Fallen  Angels
If something comes to you in a dream
Open your eyes and scream it out
Remember that the evil you rule
It's waiting outside bringing pain
By you, fallen  Angels
Yes, you know the feeling
All alone, your back to the wall
And all the doorways
Are starting to close in front of you
Well, there's no confusion
Oh no, it came in a spell
I found it in a wishing well
Now it's a matter of mind
You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone points a gun at you
Say shoot, shoot,  I don't care
Shoot, shoot
Hey, someone
If your chains are heavy for you
Hey, someone
Let it rain while  I show you the way
This could be your lucky day
It's a matter of mind
You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone points a gun at you
Hey, say shoot, shoot, you don't care
Shoot, shoot
Hey,  Shoot, shoot, anywhere
Shoot, shoot
Bang, bang
Shoot, shoot
It's a matter of mind
Shoot, shoot
You know you can be free forever
Shoot, shoot
So the next time someone points a gun at you
Hey, say shoot, shoot,  I don't care
Shoot, shoot
Oh shoot, shoot, anywhere
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot,  I won't go away
Shoot, shoot, yeah, oh
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot
You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind ( Oh-oh) can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on' Cause we rock, we rock We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, ' Oh we can find the way'
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on' Cause we rock, we rock We rock, we rock We rock, we rock We rock, we rock We rock
( We rock)
You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
Sail on, sing your song, carry on' Cause we rock, we rock We rock, we rock We rock, we rock We rock, we rock
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on Sail on, sing your song, carry on' Cause we rock, we rock See how we rock We rock, that's rock We rock, we rock We rock
We're a ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness that it needs
, yeah…
We're a laugh without a tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming… home!
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself But the only way is down
We don't come alone We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
And quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time If we're evil or divine We're the last in line
, yeah
We're the last in line, oh!
Two eyes from the east It's the  Angel or the  Beast
And the answer lies between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase is worth the pain
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
Yeah, we're the last in line, oh
Yeah!
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
You know we're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way to go is down
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, oh
We're the last in line
See all we shine
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the last in
We're the last in, we're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're a laugh without a tear
We're the far without the near
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
See how we shine
We're the last in line
You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
You're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
' Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, willing to learn
You're breathless
You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
Dark touches send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure,  I hate the light
I speed at night, at night, alright
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision,  I only see to hear
Protection,  I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to  Heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world,  I hate the light
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, alright
Dark touches send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
You've got some stairs to  Heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world,  I hate the light
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, yeah
I speed at night, night, night, night, night
I speed at night, night, night, night, night
No shadows, no faces
Just whispers in dark places
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night
I speed at night, alright
Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My  Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And  Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite,  I'm the bark,  I'm the scream
I'm the poor,  I'm the sure
I'm the holy,  I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
One night in the city
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night in the city
One night
One night feeling pretty
One night in the city
One night
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One night, one night
One night in the city
One night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night
One night in the city
One night, one night
One night, one night
One night, one night
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city
One night in the city
One night in the city
Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and  I
Oh do you ever think about the way  I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
Sail into never
They'll follow forever
' Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes
Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And  I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
It's always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Always a mystery
Just like you and me
It's always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Always a mystery
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
Always a mystery
Not what you want to see
Well, it's been a long hot road  I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But  I'm stronger than you know
And  I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But  I'm stronger than you know
And  I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat your heart out
Eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
Eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
Eat your heart out
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies
It's the same old song You gotta be somewhere sometime And they never let you fly
It's like broken glass You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Shout, stand up and shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you got to want it out
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Shout, stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And you're not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire
Go on, explode
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout
Let it out
Stand up and shout
Mhhh-hm-hmm
Yeah, yeah
Holy  Diver You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh, what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what  I mean?
Gotta get away Holy  Diver, yeah
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning You can hide in the sun 'til you see the light Oh, we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies Life's a never-ending wheel, say
Holy  Diver You're the star of the masquerade No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump; jump on the tiger You can feel his heart but you know he's mean Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Holy  Diver You've been down too long in the midnight sea Oh, what's becoming of me?
  No!  No!
Ride the tiger You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what  I mean?
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy  Diver, sole survivor You're the one who's clean
Holy  Diver,  Holy  Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you,  Holy  Diver
Oh,  Holy  Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Holy  Diver,  Holy  Diver
Oh,  Holy  Diver
Mhhh-hmmm-hmmm
Yeah, gypsy!
She was straight from  Hell But you never could tell
' Cause you were 
blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And 
turn a paler shade of white
Well  I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When  I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well  I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
But need to have a little sin
So  I'm ridin'
Well  I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well, she was straight from  Hell
But you never could tell
' Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So  I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes  I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean
Ridin' on the gypsy
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, on the queen
So, so mean
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while it can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it, you'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all, yeah
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding your way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it, you'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
I feel it,  I see it in your eyes
You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle, helpless again
Yeah, looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know, no
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river  I know that's in you flow
You can feel it, you can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it,  I see it in your eyes
You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle, helpless again
Like the rush of the thunder that brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle of
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again, oh man, oh, hey, yeah
You've been caught in the middle
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess  I never heard it,  I never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way  I've found
Oh, here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh, once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess  I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart
If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
Never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And then the light
The answer right inside her coming down, it said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
And that was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be...
Invisible
Well,  I grew up quick and  I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So  I bought the book and then  I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that  I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So  I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When  I leave here
I can be invisible
I said
When  I go away
Lord, you know it's right to leave here
So  I just became invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You never see me again because  I just become unseen
Well,  I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away
When there's lightning You know it always brings me down' Cause it's free
 
and  I see that it's me Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It went cold, lost my hold To the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and  I
We're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When  I see lightning You know it always brings me down' Cause it's free and  I see that it's me Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling you
Beware, look out!
There's no sight of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah, yeah, you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark
Woah
Shame on the night
For places  I've been and what  I've seen For giving me the strangest dreams But you never let me know just what they mean
And, oh, so, shame on the night, alright
And shame on you
You've stolen the day, snatched it away But  I saw the sky and  I never wanna die Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So  I think  I'd better run
Shame on the sun For the light you sold,  I've lost my hold On the magic flame
, but now  I know your name
Oh,  Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So  I know  I'd better run
Shame on the night
For places  I've been and what  I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
Here  I go,  I've got to run
Shame on the night
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Shame on the night
Well,  I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now  I know your name
Shame on the night
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
Shame on the night
