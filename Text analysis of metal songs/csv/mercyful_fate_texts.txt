Tonight the circle is meeting again Who will be the first to fall in trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain Tonight a spirit we will glance
So as they're approaching ghostly hour Seven people here are joining hands
They think they know the spirit to appear Contact, the table starts to dance
Time is standing still It's a dangerous meeting
They're gonna get themselves killed
Tonight, the circle is broken forever Seven people dead within a trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight, seven souls are reaching hell
Time was standing still The meeting is over
Their journey is on
Oh, they should have known Not to play with the powers of hell
Some people have lost their way
Some people have lost their mind
Am  I awake or is this just a dream?
I had a nightmare, some sort of vision
I was stuck in an empty room
When the black book appeared
The lights were dim, but the face in the
Book was in daylight
Eyes of fire staring at me
It's the eyes of a woman
And  I see, on her spirit
Steppin' out of the  Book
I hear her callin' for her coven to come
There's a light in the doorway
Entering shadows whose number is 13
They do the sign of the  Devil's seed
I'm in the middle of a magic ring
Somebody tell me, what's goin' on
" Only we know the secret of the curse
That you bear"
Listen, they sing, the coven sings
Night after night  I hear them sing
No, they're still here,  I can hear them
Again
Night after  Night  I have this dream
( You are insane!)
" You're only living on borrowed time from your fate"
Stay away white magician, young lovers
And mourning wife
You're not welcome on our land
So  I speak for the dead
Magic circles drawn after midnight
Around graves to be opened
He'll use the wand to raise a body
He'll ask the questions and he'll burn the remains
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
Copulation in the night
Two shadows upon a grave
Screams of pleasure and screams of pain
Young lovers, you must be insane
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So  I say again: stay away, it's desecration of souls
Dyin' flowers upon the grave
Of a husband who's lost his maid
She's there on duty, and the tears she cries
They don't belong where the flowers lie
It's desecration of souls in their holy lair
So  I say again: stay away, it's desecration of souls
I forbid you entrance here
You step on hallowed ground
Don't you see this chapel
Shut up, hold your tongue
They must rest in silence
It's the rebirth of the unborn
Tonight is the night
The spirits of the unborn will play tonight
The unborn will play tonight
They will dance around the chapel
It's a feast for the dead
They will make a fool of the priest
And the dead boy's choir will sing
A song for the dead
To whom life has just begun
Life of the unborn
This one's for the unborn
Did you know? 13 days have come and gone Since we had the first of  June
The spirits of the unborn will play tonight
Forgive them, they didn't die
By the symbol of the creator,  I swear henceforth to be A faithful servant of his most puissant arch-angel The prince  Lucifer, whom the creator designated as his regent And  Lord of this world,  Amen
I deny  Jesus  Christ, the deceiver And  I abjure the  Christian faith Holding in contempt all of it's works As a being now possessed of a human body In this world  I swear to give my full allegiance To it's lawful master to worship him Our  Lord oh,  Satan and no other In the name of  Satan, the ruler of earth Open wide the gates of hell and come forth from the abyss By these names, oh,  Satan,  Leviathan Belial,  Lucifer,  I will kiss the goat I swear to, to give my mind My body and soul unreservedly To the furtherance of our  Lord Our  Lord  Satan, where  Satan's designs
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be A world without end,  Amen
Ahhh...
This magic winter night  I see a light
Again  I hear that tune, some sort of croon
Oh no, no, no!  Oh, my brain
Oh whoa, oh
Ahhh...
I see them gypsy wagons left in the snow
Oh  I must see that lady,  I have to know
Gypsy woman, let me inside
Ahhh...
They say you know the secret, secret of time
So gaze into your crystal and tell me all you see
Gypsy woman, let me know
" Oh, my son, you were never gone
You are the  Devil's child and so am  I"
Gypsy now  I know you're not my mother
You're a part of my soul
It's clear for all to see
Oh no, no, no,  I am you
Gypsy you're inside of me
I turn off the lights, we like darkness
Now you call my name, you finally came
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
Now  I see you clear, we raise our glasses
Welcome to my house, princes of  Hell
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
I will bring in here my crystal ball
I will gaze, you will know what is to come
I'm amazed of what  I've seen tonight
I won't tell a living soul, they would not believe
Welcome princess of  Hell
Never will  I break the oath  I gave
I hail you again in  Satan's  Name, princes of  Hell
Even in the night  I see the light shining bright
I'm alone with my friends
We will be back, we will be back

If you say  Heaven,  I say a  Castle of  Lies
You say forgive him,  I say  Revenge
My sweet  Satan,  You are  The  One
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave, by the dead
I was made a mercenary
In the legions of  Hell
Now  I'm king of pain,  I'm insane
You know, my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love, to hear you cry
I'd love, to feel you die
And  I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And  I'll be the last, to leave
I'd love, to hear you cry
And when you're down, beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
' Cause  I will eat your mind
Away out in  Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Well, don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
Now if you're breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're starting up a curse
Bringing evil disease
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
And the curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Making it all shady
So don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me
And meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become  Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross
And go to the middle of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become  Lucifer's child
Now crush it
Crush the cross!
Suck the blood
From this unholy knife
Say after me:
My soul belongs to  Satan
Now, now you're into my coven
You are  Lucifer's child
Into the coven
Lucifer's child
Halloween is the night
The legend says the ghost will rise
On  Halloween they can't redeem
A restless soul from an ancient scene
At the sound of the demon bell
Yes, everything will turn to  Hell
Rise, rise, rise
It's  Halloween
Rise, rise
The ghost will rise
Reconciled with the powers of darkness
He'll uncover a saint
You won't believe
Better see for yourself
I hear a bell
A sound from  Hell, the demon bell
I see a lighting shadow in between the graves
Swinging his sword of hate towards the gates of  Heaven
" Beelzebub,  Astaroth
Bring me the  Devil"
And as he says these words  I can't believe my eyes
Upon a burning cross
The  Lord  Jesus,  Satan's above
It must be a shame
To see the  Lord falling again
Now rise, reconcile with the powers of darkness
Uncover a saint
You better believe or see for yourself
Bring the black box to the altar
Now raise your hands and do the sign
All hail  Satan, yes hail  Satan
Lay down your swords, the evil star
It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven
Open the black box on the altar
Her blood is still hot, so let it out
All hail  Satan, yes hail  Satan
Now drink it, now drink, drink, forget that whore
It's a black funeral
She was a victim of my coven
I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross
 upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life
Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light
She was a witch Why did they take you away?
Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light
I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of  Hell
Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?
Nothing is left outside at the stake
They've taken her away from me
( I think  Melissa's still with us)
Come and join
My black masses
Bring along
Your iron axes
Now draw a circle
Right here in the light
I'll tell you
Just what to write
Elohim...  Adonai...  Tetragrammaton
Slaughtering babies
In ceremonial ways
If we're lucky
We can see them for days
' Cause baby blood
Is full of strength
But  I tell you
Oh how it stinks
Give me some baby blood
Black masses, black masses, black masses...
Running wild
Spittin' blood
In my lady's face
I show her my pets
A few rotten heads
And about my lady
If she can't take it
She's got to face it
I'll slaughter her too
Killing babies
Black masses
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh

Who are one and all things

Without beginning, without end
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Osiris,  Anubis
The underworld is yours
Osiris,  Anubis

O  Thou,  God of the dead
Lead my soul to the  Judgment  Hall
O  Thou,  Jackal  Head

Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Ammit, eater of the dead
Is devouring my heart
Will  I pass on to  Aaru
Or will  I be condemned?
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I must be back on time
But still  I want to know
I hope they let me go
I'm from another time
And  I must reunite
My body and my soul
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
I'm burning inside to know
Osiris,  Anubis
The underworld is yours
Osiris,  Anubis
I put my soul in your hands
O thou of countless names
Who are one and all things
O thou of countless names
Without beginning, without end
Ahh,  Egypt, ahh
Egypt, come back to me
Egypt, come back to me
Egypt, without beginning or end
Back in  Tennessee
I saw a family haunted by an entity
It was a tragedy in another century
Oh, they never would know the  Evil one that came
Little  Betsy, the age of 12
Living in a dream, the first one to scream
Invisible hands
Leaving their mark in the dark
Night after night
The  Bell  Witch attacked and attacked
Torturing  Betsy
Until a circle was held in candle light
Tell us who you are?
Please tell us who you are?
I am the air you breathe
I am the  Bell  Witch
I am a million years
I am the  Bell  Witch
The  Bell  Witch decided
It was the time for the father to scream
Soon taken ill
Never again to leave his bed alive
Tell us who you are?
Please tell us who you are?
I am the air you breathe
I am the  Bell  Witch
I am a million years
I am the  Bell  Witch
Goodnight  John, see you in  Hell
Say, bye, bye to daddy,  Betsy
Call the doctor,  I made sure
Call the doctor, there ain't no cure
That night  John, he died
And the  Bell  Witch never came again
Soon they realized
The witch had given  John bad medicine
Do you remember the bridge? The bridge that was standing in ruin
Do you remember the sign? Demons and witches were doing
They say it's a bad place
They say it's a magic place
Deep down under
The soil of this unholy land
Deep down under
The roots of a tree they have damned
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
Nothing will grow in the ground
The  Old  Oak is killing it all
If you are ever around
Beware of the  Oak and its charm
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
It's the  Old  Oak  Hanging  Tree
The  Old  Oak might make you blind
The  Old  Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized...
It's a bad sign
When the  Autumn comes and the leaves are gone
Oh it's a bad sign
The  Oak must feed in order to breed
Bad sign.......  Bad sign
It's a bad sign when the  Autumn comes
And the leaves are gone
It's a nightmare found
I wonder... what made this magic tree so
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Another season in another century
Hang with me, hang with the hangman
Blood from the madmen we hung in that tree
Blood to the ground
Blood to the roots....  Red
All around the  Old  Oak
Deep into the ground they buried them
Indians of ancient times
Saw it as a holy shrine
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
Must have been a mighty  G O D
To receive a gift of life
All the people must have known
Happiness would come if sown
Can you believe, sacrificing their own
The  Old  Oak might make you blind
The  Old  Oak might trick your eyes
Hypnotized.....
No!  Don't hang with me
As  I go back to the  Old  Oak tree
When the darkness eats away the day
And the moon bears witness to the graves
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
Can you see the ghosts above our heads?
We are all in there with the dead
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
In the darkness there is no holding back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight
In the land of mystery we share
You can come along if you dare
In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, the light
We are hiding in the shadows on your wall
We are watching as you kiss your little doll
When the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see the light no more
No more
We are always in the shadows by your door
But when the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see the light no more
No more
There is no holding back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight
Everything is so strange in here
And as  I look through your eyes
I can see what you're thinking of me
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
All your secrets are done my dear
And as  I look through your eyes
I can see all the things that you fear
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
Solo:  Shermann
I'm the dreams you don't wanna

I'm the things you don't wanna see
I'm the dreams you don't wanna

I am the night of sin.....
Solo:  Denner
I wanna see you in tears
The end is near.....
I am deep inside
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Deep inside your head, causing you pain
Eternal pain
I've come to give you a gruesome time
For all the evil you have done
I'll keep a coming until the end
I'll keep a coming back my friend
The mansion was right on the shore
Down by the lake
Nobody had lived here before
But the  Devil himself
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
They would all arrive in time
Solo:  Shermann
They gathered around the mansion
Thirteen in all
They had the same intention
Never to fall
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
Promising eternal life
So you want to be alive forevermore
I will turn the wheel of time
None of you will ever have to die
I will turn the wheel of time
Turning the wheel
Turning the wheel of time
But first we must play a game
The game of souls
Sit down!  Don't move around!
Deal those cards!
They played all night 'till the morning
Light
And the  Devil, he smiled on his own
They played all night for eternal life
Or the chance of losing their souls
High will win, low is the sin
They played all night in the burning
Light
The thirteen were sharing a nine
High will win, low is the sin
The final card was in the  Devil's hand
The  King of  Diamonds would win
Solo:  Denner
Solo:  Shermann
They could never leave the mansion
Forever inside
They had lost their souls of creation
But they were alive
Thirteen invitations
Sent out through the night
Thirteen invitations
And the mansion was mine
I'm an undertaker
I'm a ghost in the night
I'm a coffin shaker
This graveyard site is mine
Take a look at the sky
See that evil eye
Tonight the moon is cold as ice
Oh, yeah, cold as ice, oh, yeah
There's a black horse waiting
Will he be on time?
The graveyard's shaking
Should  I turn my eyes and walk away
Take a look at the sky
See that evil eye
Tonight the headless rider rides
Midnight
Let the church bell ring
It's midnight,  All  Hallow's  Eve
It's midnight,  All  Hallow's  Eve
I see him rising from his grave
I see him rising from his grave
On  All  Hallow's  Eve
Never to forget
He rides the open field
In search of his head
My  God, he's so grotesque
Should  I stay?
My  God, a scythe in his hand
No way
He's coming,  I'm running
He's coming,  I'm running
Deep inside  I know  I'm the one
He's coming,  I'm running
Deep inside  I know this is wrong
Help me,  I'm falling down
I'm falling down
I'm looking up
I'm in a grave
In this hollow grave
I can smell that he's near
Will  I ever never make it?
Will  I shed a tear?
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
In this hollow grave
I see a bony hand
Don't you ever never take it
It's the key to his land
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
Oh, it's strange
How every thing's changing
Now my life is fading away
No
The mind in my headless body
Seems to be chained to the inside
I cannot move towards the light
And as he rides away
Leaving me with this curse
I hear his laughter in the distance
Actually it's my laughter
He stole my head
Does this mean  I'll be the one next year?

The son of a shepherd,  Abdul  Alhazred
Travelling in the mountains, the mountains to the east
One night before him there stood that giant rock
3 symbols carved in blood
He built a fire at its root
To protect him from the wolves
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, it was in his hands
Later that same night
Awoken by wolfen's cry
The  Arab cold with fear
Saw the rock began to rise, rise
The son of a shepherd,  Abdul  Alhazred
Shivering he saw them coming, the mountain's evil priests
Black robes came together, around the floating rock
3 symbols in the dark
They all started chanting ancient songs
It was prayer in unknown tongue
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, it was in his hands
Daggers held high to the sky
The chanting had turned to screams
From the pit where the rock had been
8 snake-like monsters came
And the symbols burned in red
And the priest had turned their heads
The blood running from their chests and daggers
Had the  Arab scream in horror giving himself away
The mad  Arab, he would understand
The mad  Arab, had to run away
Run down that mountain side
But they had seen him
The priests had caught his scent
Running faster, they're chasing him
Can't go no faster, they're still behind
Ah no, they're closing in
This house is full of hate
This house is full of madness
This house is deep insane
This house was never mine
Deep in the dark, you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
All of the deadly kisses
All of the sick, sick, sickness
All of the broken mirrors
It's here to stay forever
Deep in the dark, you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
Come along, come along
Meet my demon, demon
My demon, demon
The poison deep within
I can't let him out again
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
So here we go again
Digging the knife in
Who will be next?
Who will be our guest?
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
Who will be next?
Who will be our guest?
I hate that goddamn cellar
I wish  I never went there
It always was and will be
I cannot,  I cannot make it go away
Deep in the dark you will find us
Demon and  I, we are both deep inside
Yes, my demon and  I, we are mine
Come along, come along
Meet my demon, demon
My demon, demon
The poison deep within
I can't let him out again
The dark stains on the floor
They won't come off anymore
So here we go again
Be my guest

You believe in heaven
You believe the devil is here
When you ring your demon bell
You think  I'll end up in hell
Oh, yeah, you're the preacher
You're the devil
You're the preacher
Hiding in the underworld, that's you
I can't wait to see your final show

On a magical misty morning
I was standing in the autumn rain
Suddenly the birds fell silent
Would  I ever hear them sing again?
Hear them sing again
Without a word of warning
I saw a shadow in the autumn rain
Just like in my nightly dreams
The lady in black had come again
The lady had come again
Begging me to follow her
Into the misty rain
Begging me to follow her
Into the no more pain
Her eyes were hypnotizing
Burning deep inside my brain
The lady in black was here now
She was here to take me far away
Take me far away
Follow me to the other side
Through the tunnel of light we travel
Fading away
Through the tunnel of light we travel
We're fading away
Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
Through the light that's shining bright
We're fading away
The girl in the mirror, she's not really there
Only  I can see her, in all her misery
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Can't you feel it, those haunting eyes?
She's so divine, could be magic of a kind
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Take a look in the mirror
Deep inside there's a world of its own
Take a look in the mirror
See what you might find
Try to reach my hand
Try to reach through the glass, try, try
' Cause the longest journey is the one on your own
If we break the mirror, do you think they'll let you go
The girl in the mirror, she's caught in a spell
The girl in the mirror, between heaven and hell
Why am  I here in a quiet mortuary?
A lady and the man, flowers in their hands
Nobody sees me,  I don't understand
Nobody hears me, seems like  I don't exist
Seems like no one can hear me as  I scream
I do not feel the way  I used to be
Could it really be that the one  I see is me?
You gotta tell me why people come but never stay?
Could it really be that the one  I see is me?
Does it really matter, oh, do you really care?
Why am  I here in a quiet mortuary?
Listen to the bell, calling my name
Nobody sees me, calling my name
Nobody hears me as  I scream
Why do  I feel like  I've been left behind?
Could it really be  I'm in the afterlife?
You gotta tell me, why  I feel like  I've been left behind?
Could it really be  I'm in the afterlife?
Does it really matter, oh, do you really care?
Somewhere in ancient  Spain
Close to what was  Baecula
There lay  Castillo  Del  Mortes
To be known as ' House of the dead'
Oh, no, oh, not here
A fool was playing with magic
Magic he did not understand
He opened the unholy gates
Letting out the ancient ones from hell
Six hundred people
Standing on the castle walls
Screaming for mercy
Someone must have heard their calls
Six hundred people
Wondering what's going on
Two armies in the sky
Forming and in battle line
Hear the battle cries
Seven cohorts of angels
Fighting for the elders to win
Seven cohorts of angels
Fighting for the people within
The ' House of the dead'
Soon to be buried in sin
Nine units of demons
The ancient ones command
Nine units of demons
The ancient ones will stand
The ' House of the dead'
Will soon be buried in sin
Six hundred were watching in horror
As they began to fight
None of the armies were using a weapon
As it is known to man
Demons and angels were falling in numbers
Out of the burning sky, the burning sky
Retreat, retreat, oh, the angels flee
Defeat, defeat, the battle's over, it's done
Somewhere in ancient  Spain
Close to what was  Baecula
There lay the battleground
Where many an angel was slain
Nine units of demons
Bringing unbearable sin
Nine units of demons
Coming for the people within
The ' House of the dead'
Will soon live up to its name
Six hundred people
Running deep inside
Six hundred people
Trying to hide
From the ancient ones
But there's nowhere to run on this day
There is no need to speak of the horrible fate
Bestowed upon the six hundred from  Baecula
Our father who art in  Hell
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom is come
Thy will is done
On earth as it is in  Hell
We take this night our rightful due
And trespass not on the path of  He
Lead us unto temptation
And deliver us from false piety
For thine is the  Kingdom
And the  Power
And the  Glory
Forever
Shemhamforash!
There's a little old man, standing by my window
There's a little old man, hiding in the shadows
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man,  I'd say he looks like  Misery
There's a little old man,  I could really use his company
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
Come inside and stay for a little while
Come in from the cold and warm your heart
Come inside and tell me who you are
Come in from the cold and warm your heart
" You would not know of me, we never met before
The name is  Damian and  I used to live in this house"
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
There's a little old man...  I'd say he looks like  Misery
There's a little old man...  I could really use his company
The uninvited guest could never have been a friend
The uninvited guest, he would never come back again
So,  I said farewell until we meet again
You can come again my friend, any day you want
I later learned that he was never here
I later learned that he'd been dead a year
The uninvited
Walking on a cold and white  December night
I hear the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Do you still remember the old oak tree?
I do, the feeling's coming back to me
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
I took her hand and then we walked into the night
I took her hand and then we watched the moon go by
Memories of long forgotten times
I took a chance to relive my life and then  I saw her, she smiled
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
The same
Walking on a cold and white  December night
I hear, the voices from the other side
Calling my name, must be that olden friend
I think she has come to see me once again
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
Ghost of change, do you remember my name?
You are the ghost of change and now we meet again
You are the ghost of change but  I will always stay the same
Up in the hills where the sun goes down
There's an old black church and a broken town
The sun goes down
The trees are dead and the river is dry
And they blame it all on the old belfry
The devils cry
Why?  Why?  Why?  Listen to the bell
Why?  Why?  Why?
Listen to the bell and it just might tell you why
It's a dark and lonely road to the old belfry
And if you're alone, you'll never survive... No.. No.. No
Deep...in the shadows
Everywhere  I hear the devils cry
Why?  Why?  Do the devils cry?
Why?  Why?  Why?  Do the devils cry?
I have seen the gateway that leads beyond
So far away from the burning sun
I've seen the  Maker,  I've seen the  Taker
I've seen whatever you call them there
The blazing ruby eyes in the old belfry
Listen to the bell if you wanna know why
You gotta listen to the bell
And then you just might hear the sound of  Hell
Why?... Why?... Why?... You gotta tell me why
Why?... Why?  Why do the devils cry?
Why?... Why?  Why do the devils cry?
1640, the  Caribbean sea
The wind was just a breeze
Heading for a western shore, the barque was sailing east
Close hauled into the eye
The unicorn was riding high on the tide
And the rum went down their throats, with a twist of wine
Just after midnight, nobody saw the  Antigua shore
Just after midnight, nobody heard the thunder roar
Oh, they were heading straight for the reefs
Just after midnight, they were caught by the storm
1640, the  Caribbean sea
The wind was not just a breeze
The captain and the crew were fighting for their lives
But they didn't stand a chance with their drunken minds
Going down, to their watery graves
Going down, going down
Fifteen men and a bottle of rum
It's the captain and the crew of the unicorn
Listen hard on a stormy night
And you just might hear them singing that rhyme
Oh yeah, a ghost that never dies
Fifteen men and a bottle of rum
It's the captain stuck in the unicorn
Oh yeah, a ghost that never dies
It's a warning, storm is coming
Yeah, you better look out
Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the lights go dim
While  I dig into your soul my friend
Looking for sin, sin, sin, looking for sin, sin
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Darkness we are here tonight to select who's gonna die
Has everyone arrived?
Darkness open wide and let the show begin
While we look into the southern wind
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Someone here will not survive the night that's creeping by
This is your time, not mine, for another life, don't you see
Don't you see, you took a chance, now you must pay
Say your last goodbye, this is your time, not mine
For another life, now die, die, die
It is so much colder in here
Hold on to your soul my dear
It is so much colder in here
Hold on to nothing
Ooh, ooh
Who should  I let go?  Who needs to know?
The journey of a lonely soul
Now you're on your own, yeah
The maker's waiting down the road
The dying has begun
Now my finger points at you
It is time for you to pay what's due
Now my finger points at you
And you must know what you never ever knew
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Oh, yeah, you're going into the unknown
Now my finger points at you, and you must know
What you never ever knew
There is something out there waiting for me
With an evil glow
There is something out there that will
Never let me go
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
I have seen the  Southern witches, in the church of  God
I have seen the  Southern witches, and the  Holy  Ghost
Dancing, blasphemous, waiting for him to call
Dancing, blasphemous, uniting them all
And  I know this night so well
Cause  I have walked from here to hell
The only thing  I can never tell
Is why they put me under the spell
Under the spell
Was it the deadly moon that gave me away
On  Walpurgis  Night
Was it the deadly moon that gave me away
Or the evil eye
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
Twisting, turning,  I'm looking out for my soul
And then he came at last
Suddenly the  Earth was shaking
And  I,  I couldn't feel a thing as  I saw him
Standing on the altar
He was drinking all the wine
While the  Holy  Ghost and the  Southern witches
Were turning every single cross around and upside down
I never should have been there
I never should have seen it
I never should have understood
Lie down in your dead, little baby
You know it's getting late
Listen to this deadtime story
And hold on to your head
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Little blood  Red  Riding  Hood
Was passing through the woods
A basket full of poisoned fruit
She's absolutely way too cute
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Good old  Nick is in her blood
And it makes me feel so hot
Devil eyes, that's no surprise
She's colder than ice
The werewolf's hiding
With its yellow glowing eyes
Drooling for baby blood
He's jumping in the night
And he knows where  Red is riding
He knows here  Grandma well
That big bad werewolf's got it down
He cannot fail
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
Grandma's waiting in here dead
For sweetest  Little  Red
When she ate the werewolf's head
You could not even tell
There is no way out, there's no way out
For sweetest  Little  Riding  Hood
' Cause  Granny won't be full
Until  Red is dead and gone, bye, bye
And it is way past her deadtime
The night has just died
I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water,  I guess  I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the devil's well and then  I'll go to hell
I'd rather drink from the devil's well
And then  I will go straight to hell, ohh, yeah
High on the mountain of  Poltersberg there is a quiet lake They say it's full of demons, that  Satan keeps them there
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
Cast a stone into this lake and soon a storm will rise
And suck out all the demons, up into the sky
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
Ohh, holy water, ohh, holy water
I don't want that holy water, it makes me burn
I don't want that holy water,  I guess  I'll never learn
I'd rather drink from the devil's well and then  I'll go to hell
I'd rather drink from the devil's well
And then  I will go straight to hell, ohh, yeah
Deep in the valley of  Blankenstein there is a sacred pool
They say that you can drink this water, it's cleansing of the soul
Wash away your darkest sins, if that's what you believe
But keep in mind that if you do, who is it you deceive?
I don't want that holy water, no, no, no, no, no
It makes me burn inside
I don't want that holy water, ohh, no
Someone better come and save my life
Someone better kill those evil eyes
Is it in my mind or are they still behind?
Turning slowly,  I see,  I see,  I see there's no one there
Ohh, someone better tell me what it's all about?
In the dying fire, moonlight has struck my eye
I feeling colder,  I see,  I see,  I see the amulet
Of evil gods, evil gods
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu
Traveling for years in the mountain side
Traveling for years to believe in the sign
And  I know them well now, all of the ancient ones
Eyes turning slowly,  I see,  I see,  I see there's no one there
Ohh, someone must have broken the holy seal
' Cause  I know they're there, just like that fateful night
I feeling colder,  I see,  I see,  I see the amulet
Of evil gods, evil gods
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices in my head?
Can you hear the voices, what they say?
Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu,  Kutulu
Hear me as  Kutulu raises his evil head
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow,  I might be of the dead
I'm burning up,  I'm burning up
I wish for you, the gods will be merciful
Drooling for my soul
I must finish this book tonight
Tomorrow,  I might be of the dead
I'm burning up,  I'm burning up
I wish for you, the gods will be merciful
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In  London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when  I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when  I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if  I'm near
I'm sly and  I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for " The  Ripper"
Or if you like " Jack  The  Knife"
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper...the ripper....the ripper
Anna... was praying to a god
She had betrayed, so they said
Some folk had seen her flying on a broom
All hallows eve, under the moon
The inquisitor had left her behind
Gone for a bite, food on his mind
The sun was slowly trying to hide
Behind a town so full of pride
A sight anna would never see again
Torture in the name of christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of christ, you witch you... confess
Solo: shermann
Sitting naked on the wooden horse
Weights to her legs, what a holy cross
Her bloody hands tied to her back
Her golden hair burned to black
Thumbscrews they had used
To crush each tip of her fingers to a pulp
In the torture chamber, she couldn't feel much more
Of anything... anymore
Torture in the name of christ, confess, oh you witch
Torture in the name of christ, you witch you... confess
Satan's mark... had slipped away
They already searched her body twice today
And it was all in vain
Oh anna here they come again
Off the horse, strapado for a friend
Up she goes, higher and higher
Anna's crying, screaming: "liars"
Solo: shermann-wead
Confess, confess witch
Confess, before you die
"yes, yes, i am a witch, may satan take you all"
Solo: wead
They dropped her from the ceiling
To a foot above the floor
Her ams and legs disjointed
Screams of pain... then finally no... more
Old  Nick is by my side,  I hear no evil
As  I walk into the night,  I see no evil
Old  Nick is by my side,  I feel no evil
Oh...  I'm gonna love this night... it's gonna be just fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
Old  Nick... my imaginary friend
Old  Nick is not what they say, here we go again
Through the dark on a snake we ride, the  Devil's child
Oh... the moon is bright, she's oh so fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is,  The  Night
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is,  The  Night
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Looking through a  Demon's eye
We're gonna spy on  God
Find out if he really is
Find out if she really is
Solo:  Shermann
Old  Nick is by my side,  I feel no evil
Oh...  I'm gonna love this night... it's gonna be just fine
The two of us at midnight, a feeling of  Hell
The two of us at midnight...
Just him and  I, we're gonna spy on  God
The  Night
Find out who he really is
Find out who she really is,  The  Night
Find out if hee really is
Find out if she really is,  The  Night...
On this cold and windy  Sunday
I'm sitting here alone...  It's  Autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever
Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember... the days...
When we were young
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
I have been reading your letter, over and over again
I can't believe you're gonna be here today
I can't believe... this is  Sunday
How nice of you to come, it's been so way too long
Let me get you another glass of wine
To keep our tingues in time
Solo:  Wead
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
So many things have never been told
And now the both of us are way too old
Solo:  Shermann
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
Like the light of the sun
You used to brightened my day
But darkness ha taken your place
And  I can no longer keep it away
Since forever,  I still remember your ways
Since forever,  I still remember
I ask you for one last time
No there won't be any wine
Just one more time
So you can put flowers on my grave
And then leave again... since forever
Many have seen the statue that cries
But only  I have seen her at night
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say that her... tears can heal you, but
When the sun goes down, and my day begins
That's when  I saw her change
Her tears did turn to blood, just like a miracle
And through her mouth of stone,  I saw the fire
From so deep inside,  I heard a voice from  Hell
" I am the lady who cries,  I am he who lights the night"
" I am  Lucifer"
Solo:  Shermann
Many say that it... is a miracle
Many say ther her... tears can heal you, but
From so deep inside,  I hear a voice from hell
" I am the lady who cries,  I am he who fights the night"
Solo:  Wead
" I'm your eternal friend"
" Let my children come to me at day
Let my children come to me and pray"
Solo:  Wead
" They don't know who  I am
Or that they worship the  Devil
They don't know who  I am
They think  I'm a miracle..."
I heard it... in my sleep last night
I heard it... in your sleep last night
Now  I can hear it again, outside the night is sad
I know it's not the wind, outside the night is black
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
I know that,  I must tell you a lie
I know that, it could be you and not  I
Before the sun is rising, the  Banshee cannot stay
Before the night is dying, a life will slip away
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
I must light a fire, to chase away the night
Let us hold each other tight
The cats are gone,  I guess... they know
Oh... they know what's gonna come
Solo:  Wead
The wailing is so much louder,  I need to hold you tight
I can feel you getting colder, is it time for you or  I?
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the  Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon
Let it be me
Poisonous  Mandrake, you danerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
White  Mandragora, with you root so thick, you are the male
Black as the night on the outside, inside you're like a moon
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am  I losing my mind?
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
In the olden days it was believed
That in the dark of night, you had to
Tie a string from the neck of a
Black dog to the  Mandrake root, then move away, move away
And with meat you must lure the dog
To pull the  Mandrake root from the ground
Cover your ears... cause the cry of the  Mandrake root
No man has ever survived, the dog will surely die
Solo:  Wead
Poisonous  Mandrake, you dangerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come
You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the  Devil might take you for a man
Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am  I losing my mind?
Mandrake root, bring me your poisonous love
Mandrake root,  I need you to bring me that love
Mandrake root...  Mandrake root bring me love
Mandrake root, bring me that poisonous thing
That everyone is calling  L O V E
I can see it in your mystery eyes
I can feel it on your breath tonight
The yearning for time, the yearning for eternal life
Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood, oh... oh... oh
Let me look you deep in the eyes
Let me look... into your mind
Let me take you to a room full of life
Let me, let me, let me suck your wine
Oh...oh...oh...sucking your blood
Oh...oh...oh...sucking you, sucking your blood
A  Chandelier is our source of light
I'm breathing in the golder air tonight
Time... is right, it's your innocent skin  I like
Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood, oh... oh... oh
Your neck is so delicately white, inviting my mouth for the bite
My teeth... your vein, like wine from a chalice  I drink
Oh...oh...oh...sucking your blood
Oh...oh...oh...sucking you, sucking your blood
Solo:  Shermann
Your warm juices colour my throat
What unheavenly joy, turning yours into mine
Me... part of you, oh you are the wine
Sucking your blood before the night is torn
How could this ever, ever be a sin
If you would pull the stake from my heart
If you would let me draw another card
Maybe the  Morning  Star will blind our eyes
Maybe the  Morning  Star will bless another night
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
Maybe the  Morning  Star will blind our eyes
Maybe the  Morning  Star will bless another night
Me... part of you, you are the wine
Why do  I keep on doing this?  It's not for me anymore
I'm doing this more for you than  I
And on that lonely road to nowhere
I lost myself to something else
I don't know where  I'm going or where  I've been
It's so hard to remember all the things  I am, am  I?
It feels like the end is near, catching up with me
Catch me if you can, cause  I'm going down into the ground
How much longer can  I keep going on?
I can feel my lost ones coming down
Sooner than later,  I'll see you all again
I feel my purpose here slipping away
I see the sun, but it's raining
I hope  I'm on my way to better things
And if  I'm not, it doesn't really matter
Cause  I am doing this more for you than  I am me
I can no longer pretend, that my life is worth living
I...  I would rather die, be dead again
Hold on
Now here it comes, death for one, a lonely son
Up then down,  I'm spinning around
My sould is so confused again
Am  I floating towards the sun?
Hold on, am  I dead on?
Solo:  Shermann
Through a tunnel of black, why?
Why do  I feel so sad?
I've been waiting for the end of act 9 to come
The curtain must fall, the end of a song
Solo:  Wead
But the song goes on and on
The light is so very strong
I'm drifting along,  I have no will
I'm drifting still
In a room without walls...  I feel the chill
No one is here to pick me up
Nothingess... what a mess... oh
Is anybody there?
Is anybody there?  I'm talking to you, do you hear me?
If  I could only see through the wall of nothingness
The wall of black
They gave me number 9, this is not like the last time
Number 9
This time  I am really losing my mind
I hear an orchestra...  I see an orchestra
I greet an orchestra...  I meet an orchestra
I'm in an orchestra...  I am an orchestra
I kill this orchestra...  I kill me?  No
No don't stop, oh please don't stop
Hey stay here, what's going on?... hey wait for me
Solo:  Shermann- Wead
I'm running but  I can't keep up
Then  I realize my feet are gone
This is such a weird weird song
The orchestra is now a door
One is one and two is four,  I can see three more
Seven doors, seven doors
I must choose one before they're gone
But  I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
But  I cannot move, oh they are drifting away now
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
I've got to reach that door, the number 6
The number 6-6, the number 6-6-6
The number 6-6-6
The number 6-6-6, that's my door
Wuauuu... look at all the colours
There goes an orchestra, no more doors
Close the window, here they come
I hear another end of this song
But again the song goes on
Dead again,  I know cause  I've been here before
I'm dead agin, if  I could only reach that door
The number 6-6-6, the number 6-6-6
I'm beginning to miss you again
Why can't  I just get you out of my mind...
I must forget
Dead again,  I know cause  I've been here before
I'm dead again, if  I could only reach that door
Through a purple mist the light is fading
I guess  I'll have to stay dead
A little longer this time
Dead again...
In the mirror...  I have seen  H I M
And he scares me
The crature... behind the mask  I wear
I know his name is  F E A R
In the mirror... he's looking back at me
I have to face him every day
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
The man... in the mirror, he scares me
For  I know him not so well
The creature... behind the mask  I wear
I know his name is  F E A R
In the mirror... it's not omy eyes  I see
But they are always there
I cannot let it show,  N O  O N E must ever know
The horror that lies so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
So deep within, yet so far away
I... wonder, will he always stay
Stay so deep within, deep within my soul
And  I know him not so well, his name is  F E A R
Solo:  Wead
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What  I need to know
No man... nor any book, will ever teach me
What  I'm longing for
Only the creature... living inside of me
Could show me the meaning of life
I cannot let it show,  N O  O N E must ever know
The horror that lives so deep within
Tucked away beneath my skin
And it scares me, yes it scares me
You are  Selene, the moon in heaven
You are  Persephone,  Queen of the  Underworld
Hecate... darkness and terror of the night
Hecase... oh, the crossroads are thine
You are  Diana, you are the hunter of souls
The dogs are howling, we dogs know when you approach
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight, oh let us ride
Solo:  Shermann
At the crossroads, they buried criminals and suicides
At the crossroads, any traveller could lose a life
A suitable place, for making a pact with the  Devil
A suitable place, for us to hold the sabbath
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride to the crossroads
Let us ride with a beast tonight
Let us ride in the dead of night...
Even you mortals can ride with her at night
And join the night-flying demons, oh you and  I
Listen to their tales of wandering ghosts
Listen to their tales of forgotten times
Listen to their tales of the crossroads
Listen to their tales of forgotten lives
I'm surrounded by darkness, I'm dying in my bed
I don't know if  I'm going to survive
I open my eyes,but it's so hard to see
My  Last  Rites
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
In a flick of a second  I think  I saw a priest
Listening to my breathing getting weaker all the time
He's mumbling words  I don't understand
My  Last  Rites
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
Feeling colder,feeling low
My blood still running,but running slow
Oh no... I don't need no priest of yours...oh  Christ
I won't listen to another word from you
Here  I am dying and you act the fool
I wish you'd come a little closer
So  I can reach your cross and end your prayer here
I don't believe in heaven, I don' t believe in hell
So save your god for someone else
Or save him for yourself
Oh  Father... did you speak to  God?
Oh  Father... did he speak to you?
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father... your eyes could heal the sick
Yeah, heal the sick
Oh  Father... no one could ever forget
Oh  Father... the night your eyes went black
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father...  God left you for dead
It was a black year for the  Church of  Saint  Anne
It was a black year when the miracles began
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
The sick got sicker and the well got ill
Your congregation said you lost " God's will"
You ran to the altar, said another prayer
You ran to the altar, but  God was never there
So they threw you out, and stoned you down
Stoned you down to the ground
It was a black year for the  Church of  Saint  Anne
It was a black year when the miracles began
In the  Church of  Saint  Anne
Oh  Father... betrayed by your own
Oh  Father... did  Satan take your soul?
They found him in the tower hanging from the bell
A twisted smile on his face as if he came straight from  Hell
" If thine eyes deceive thee, pluck them out"
I sold my soul to you, I sold my soul to the  Devil his due
I... I sold my soul
I sold my soul,and  I sold yours too " To the  Devil we're due"
Ohhh... I sold my soul
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you...to the  Devil his due
I sold my soul
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no!
No point in turning around,just live with the fear
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you
To the  Devil his due
So many angels were falling from the sky
So many angels would have to die...
A black candle in my hand,a pact between  God and man
Oh your  Majesty,this time  I have to know
I sold my soul to you, I sold my soul to the  Devil his due
I... I sold my soul
I sold my soul,and  I sold yours too " To the  Devil we're due"
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you...to the  Devil his due
No point in turning around,there's no way out of here,no!
No point in turning around,just live with the fear
That night was the darkest of all
That night  I sold my soul to you
To the  Devil his due
So many angels were falling from the sky
So many angels would have to die...
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
If you dare then come with me
To the  House on the  Hill and you will see
Nothing is what it seems  In the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
While you were asleep
Another friend of mine has come from the  Keep
The well in the cellar my dear -  That's how  I keep them near
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to the  House on the  Hill
Let's go to where time stands still
In my little shrine
I keep the stillborn to be born another time
The souls that  God didn't hear - oh  I keep them near
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
In the  House on the  Hill
It is so very strange,to live among the stillborn
It is so very strange,to keep their souls away from harm
I was one of the mentally ill,who stayed in a cell of his own
I was one of the mentally ill,who used to call this home
Oh you're not alone
All your sins are forgiven
In the name of  Jesus in heaven... Ahhh
There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking...that  God would understand
Satan take him to where you dwell
Satan take him to burn in hell
Always were a believer
You never thought of  God as the  Deceiver... Ahhh
There you stood with your soul in your hand
Thinking...that  God would understand
Satan take him to where you dwell
Satan take him to burn in hell
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Where is your  Jesus now, Jesus in  Heaven
Where is your saviour of all
He's executing your soul
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Jesus and  Satan hand in hand
Leading you down the stairway to the damned
No more pearly gates for you
Eternal flames,wondering who is who... Ahhh
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Burn  In  Hell... Drown in my wishing well
Where is your  Jesus now, Jesus in  Heaven
Where is your saviour of all
He's executing your soul
Burn  In  Hell... Burn  In  Hell
There is a cemetary just  East of here
That's where they say the  Devil,the  Devil is always near
Come to the  Grave
The  Grave that comes alive, The  Grave that feeds the night
Bring your  Book of  Spells
Ancient rites,magic signs,bring your sacrifice
It's time to draw the circle around  The  Grave
Now don't you break the circle,tonight is not a game
Come to  The  Grave
Rise evil demon,up into the night
Is that you... Baphomet,the inverted star
We visit here at midnight,we stay until the daylight
Is that you... Baphomet,the inverted star
We visit here at midnight,we stay until the daylight
There is a cemetary just  East of here
That's where they say the  Devil,the  Devil is always near
Come to the  Grave
The  Grave that comes alive, The  Grave that feeds the night
Bring your  Book of  Spells
Ancient rites,magic signs,bring your sacrifice
I see little demons,are they in my head?
I see little demons,fightin in my bed
Why did  I go insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
Screams in the night, I hear another one died
Was it number 9,or was it me who cried
Why did  I go insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
When  I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank
My brain is burning up, Insanity...
When  I look in the mirror,my mind is, Dead
Is it me on the other side?
I saw the look on your face,the night they took me away
Not a tear,not a trace,just stood there waving goodbye
Dead roses in my room,a love that died too soon
When  I look in the mirror,my mind goes blank
My brain is burning up, Insanity...
When  I look in the mirror,my mind is, Dead
Sanity turned  Insane, I hange myself in a picture frame
I'm so tired,let me sleep
I'm counting demons...
Why did  I go  Insane?  Oh doctor kill the pain
Oh doctor kill the pain,oh doctor kill the pain
Kiss the little  Demon, hanging on my wall
Kiss the little  Demon, he will answer your call
You better watch out... God forsaken heaven
I am alone in the dark when  I call the  Demon's name
I  Am... Am  I the one who's insane?
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let  Him taste a little of your blood
Kiss the little  Demon,hanging on my wall
Kiss the little  Demon,he will answer your call
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let  Him taste a little of your blood
I send you my  Demon to blacken his brain
I send you my  Demon to rip out his veins
Rise from  Hell and serve me well
Rise... Demon rise
You better watch out... God forsaken heaven
I am alone in the dark when  I call the  Demon's name
I  Am... Am  I the one who's insane?
Kiss the  Demon,he'll make your wish come true
Kiss the  Demon
Stick out your tongue and let him taste a little of your life
A little of your blood
A little of your soul
The poison is still in your veins
The poison  I slipped in your drink
Cannot see me,  I am but a ghost
Never saw your dangerous host
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
All you can see in the darkness above
Is the white in my eye...
I'm standing on the edge of your grave
Looking down into the eyes of the dead
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
How does it feel with my foot on your chest?
How does it feel? ( Tell me and  I might forget)
How does it feel to be so out of breath?
How does it feel? ( Tell me and  I might forget)
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
He started struggling, oh the fool
Moonlight shining in his drool
I slammed the shovel straight between his eyes
" Stay down,"  I screamed, " You're here to die!"
Never saw me,  I am but a ghost
Never saw your dangerous host
Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
All you can see in the darkness above
Is the white in my eye
I'm standing on the edge of your grave
Looking down into the eyes of the dead
Buried  Alive.... Buried  Alive
No matter what it is you believe
You're lucky if you die in your sleep
" Murder!" he screamed, " Oh why!?" but that's a lie
You killed me first, so now die
I'm dead, but you die,  I'm gonna bury you alive
" Murder!" he screamed, " Oh why?!"
In hell
Are we all in hell? are we in heaven?
Heaven...heavenly hell
We are 9
Good and evil,dark and light
We are 9,9 we are
I am 9...you are 9...we are 9
God is satan deep below,satan is  God high above
In the end it's all the same
Who are we to play their game
We are 9
9 we are all 9 we are 9 we are all 9
In hell
Are we in hell?
Time has disappeared into an unknown evil
In heaven? heaven...heavenly hell
I am 9...you are 9...we are 9
I am 9...you are 9...we are
